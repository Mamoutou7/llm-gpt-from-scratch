Preface



The whole world needs agriculture because agriculture does not only feed the entire

human race but also produces fibre for clothing, feed for livestock and bio-energy. In

the developing world agriculture contributes significantly to the gross domestic

product, leads the way in reducing poverty and accounts for the lion’s share of

employment opportunities especially for women. Agriculture also has one of the

highest potentials for reducing carbon emissions and helping vulnerable people adapt

to climate change.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations and the World

Bank have indicated that:



100% of the global population depends on agriculture for nutrition



40% of the global population relies on agriculture for employment



70% of worldwide withdrawal of water is for the purposes of agriculture



30% proportion of greenhouse gas emissions is related to agriculture



70% increment in food production is needed to feed a global population of 9

billion by 2050.

These figures by the FAO and the World Bank indicate that without agriculture, the

world economy would not be what it has been and what it is today.

For agriculture to continuously contribute to food security, environmental

sustainability and economic opportunities by driving the rural and national economic

development with well targeted investments, it is imperative that the research and

development agenda which is based on the science behind agriculture must be

pursued vigorously. It is in this context that this book, Agricultural Science has been

written with multiple authors compiling some important state-of-the art contributions

on the subject in recent years.

The contributions of chapters in the book are divided into seven sections: Crop

Improvement, Crop Production, Crop Response to Water and Nutrients, Crop

Response to Temperature, Crop Protection, Agriculture and Human Health, and

Animal Nutrition. The sections vary in the number of chapters which was largely due

to the number of authors who contributed chapters to publish the book. The chapters

in each section and in the book in general vary in scope and the way they attempt to

Impact of Epistasis in Inheritance of

Quantitative Traits in Crops

1. Introduction

Epistasis is the interaction between alleles of different genes, i.e. non-allelic interaction, as opposed to dominance, which is interaction between allele of the same gene, called inter-allelic or intra-genic interaction (Kearsey and Pooni, 1996). Statistical epistasis describes the deviation that occurs when the combined additive effect of two or more genes does not

explain an observed phenotype (Falconer and Mackay, 1996).

The heritability of a trait, an essential concept in genetics quantitative, “certainly one of the central points in plant breeding research is the proportion of variation among individuals in a population that” is due to variation in the additive genetic (i.e., breeding) values of individuals:

h2 = VA/VP = Variance of breeding values/ phenotypic variance (Lynch and Walsh, 1998).

This definition is now termed “heritability in the narrow-sense” (Nyquist, 1991). Estimation of this parameter was prerequisite for the amelioration of quantitative traits. As well as choosing the selective procedure, that will maximize genetic gain with one or more selection cycles.

Various methods were developed in the past, Warner (1952), Sib-Analysis, Parent-offspring regressions etc. Theses methods considered that additive-dominant model is fitted, assuming epistasis to be negligible or non existent. Because of the complexity of theoretical genetics studies on epistasis, there is a lack of information about the contribution of the epistatic components of genotypic variance when predicting gains from selection. The estimation of

epistatic components of genotypic variance is unusual in genetic studies because the limitation of the methodology, as in the case of the triple test cross, the high number of generations to be produced and assessed (Viana, 2000), and mainly because only one type of progeny, Half-Sib, Full-Sib or inbred families, is commonly included in the experiments (Viana, 2005). If there is no epistasis, generally it is satisfactory to assess the selection efficiency and to predict gain based on the broad-sense heritability. Therefore, the bias in the estimate of the additive variance when assuming the additive-dominant model is considerable. The preponderance of

epistasis effect in the inheritance of quantitative trait in crops was recently reported by many geneticists (Pensuk et al., 2004; Bnejdi and El Gazzah, 2008; Bnejdi et al. 2009; Bnejdi and El-Gazzah, 2010a; Shashikumar et al. 2010). Epistasis can have an important influence on a

number of evolutionary phenomena, including the genetic divergence between species.

The aims of our study were to determine the importance of epistasis effects in heredity of quantitative traits and their consequences in the bias of four methods of estimation of

narrow-sense heritability.

2. Origin of data and genetic model

Nine quantitative traits with 88 cases of combination cross-site, cross-isolate or cross-

treatment of six generations (P1, P2, F1, F2, BC1 and BC2) for three crops ( Triticum Durum, Capsicum annum and Avena sp) were collected from different works realised in our laboratory. Crops, traits and origin of data are reported in Table 1. For each trait parents of crosses were extreme. Transformations (such as Kleckowski transforms (Lynch and Walsh,

1998)) were applied to normalize the distribution of data or to make means independent of variances for several traits.

2.1 Best genetic model

Weighted least squares regression analyses were used to solve for mid-parent [M] pooled additive [A], pooled dominance [D] and pooled digenic epistatic ([AA], [DD] and [AD])

genetic effects, following the models and assumptions described in Mather and Jinks (1982).

A simple additive-dominance genetic model containing only M, A and D effects was first tested using the joint scaling test described in Rowe and Alexander (1980). Adequacy of the genetic model was assessed using a chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic derived from

deviations from this model. If statistically significant at P < 0.05, genetic models containing digenic epistatic effects were then tested until the chi-square statistic was non-significant.

3. Phenotypic resemblance between relatives

We now will use the covariance (and the related measures of correlations and regression

slopes) to quantify the phenotypic resemblance between relatives. Quantitative genetics as a field traces back to Fisher’s 1918 paper showing how to use the phenotypic covariance to

estimate genetic variances, whereby the phenotypic covariance between relatives is

expressed in terms of genetic variances, as we detail below.

3.1 Parent-offspring regressions

There are three types of parent-offspring regressions: two single parent - offspring

regressions (plotting offspring mean versus either the trait value in their male parent Pf or their female parent Pm), and the mid-parent-offspring regression (the offspring mean regressed on the mean of their parents, the mid-parent MP = ( Pf + Pm) / 2).

The slope of the (single) parent-offspring regression is estimated by

Where Oi is the mean trait value in the offspring of parent i (Pi) and we examine n pairs of parent-offspring. One could compute separate regressions using males ( Pm) and females ( Pf), although the later potentially includes maternal effect contributions and hence single-parent regressions usually restricted to fathers.

4. Results and discussion

Separate generation means analysis revealed that the additive-dominance model was

found adequate only for 18 cases. Therefore, the digenic epistatic model was found

appropriate for 70 cases (Table 2). Additive and dominance effect were significant for all cases of combination. With regard to epistatic effects, the additive x additive effect was significant for 77 cases and the additive x dominance for 42 cases and dominance x

dominance effects for 56 cases. Recent studies suggest that epistatic effects are present for inheritance of quantitative traits in many species. Examples are wheat (resistance to leaf rust, Ezzahiri and Roelfs 1989), wheat (resistance to yellowberry, Bnejdi and El Gazzah

2008), common bean (resistance to anthracnose, Marcial and Pastor 1994), barley

(resistance to Fusarium head blight, Flavio et al. 2003), chickpea (resistance to Botrytis cinerea, Rewal and Grewal 1989), and pepper (resistance to Phytophthora capsici, Bartual et al. 1994).

To conclude for this part, the additive dominance model was rarely fitted and digenic

epistatic model was frequently appropriate. Therefore epistasis is common in inheritance of quantitative traits and any model or methods assumed that epistasis was negligible were

biased.

The comparison of the four methods is reported in Table 3. In absence of dominance and

epistatic effect, the methods were not biased. Therefore, in presence of epistasis narrow-sense heritability based on the four methods was underestimated. Based in Full-Sib Analysis and Warner (1952) methods, bias was caused by dominance, interaction between

homozygote loci, interaction between heterozygote loci and interaction between

homozygote and heterozygote loci. Therefore based in Half-Sib Analysis and Parent-

offspring regressions, bias was caused only with the presence of interaction between

homozygote loci or fixable effect.

The result of generations means analysis indicate that digenic epistasis model were

frequently appropriate. So the additive model in which many methods of genetic

quantitative were based was rarely adequate. Based on the result, the methods of Half-Sib Analysis and Parent-offspring regressions were underestimated with additive x additive

effect (Table 3). Because additive x additive effect can be fixed by selection, estimation of narrow-sense heritability with theses methods was recommended and efficiency in crops

breeding. Linkage disequilibrium and absence of epistasis are compulsorily assumed in

almost all the methodologies developed to analyze quantitative traits. The consequence,

clearly, is biased estimates of genetic parameters and predicted gains, as linkage and

genetic interaction are the rule and not the exception Viana (2004). The prediction of gains from selection allows the choice of selection strategies. Therefore the gain from selection was estimated from narrow-sense heritability. Breeding strategies applied for plant

breeding aimed to increase the favourable gene frequency. The efficiency of any

methodology of selection was associated with the best estimated of the additive genetic

effect value.

In presence of epistasis effect, Parent-offspring regressions and Half-Sib Analysis were the best methods. In fact, these methods were biased only with interaction between

homozygote loci represented by “additive x additive” effect. However, both the methods

of Warner (1952) and Full-Sib Analysis were biased with dominance, additive x

dominance, dominance x dominance and additive x additive effects. The interaction

between the homozygote loci can be fixed by selection. But the fixation of interaction

between heterozygote loci prerequisite maintain of heterozygote. Depending upon the

methods, the bias in the estimation of narrow-sense heritability in presence of epistasis was more pronounced.

The presence of epistasis complicated the procedure of amelioration of quantitative traits and revealed the limitation of most quantitative studies based on the assumption of

negligible epistasis. However, the exploitation of epistasis in the breeding program such as the superiority of heterozygous genotypes over their corresponding parental genotypes was of great importance.

1. Introduction

Heliconia cultivation has intensified in Brazil as a cut flower, especially in the Northeast region. This ornamental rhizomatous herbaceous plant from the Heliconia genus, belongs to the Musaceae family, now constitutes the Heliconiaceae family in the Zingiberales order.

The various species of Heliconia are subdivided into five subgenera: Heliconia, Taeniostrobus, Stenochlamys, Heliconiopsis and Griggisia; and 28 sections (Kress et al., 1993). In Heliconia genus, the number of species ranges from 120 to 257 and there are also a great number of

cultivars and 23 natural hybrids (Berry and Kress, 1991; Castro et al., 2007), these plants can be found either in shaded places, such as forests or at full Sun areas, such as forest edges and roadsides (Castro and Graziano, 1997). They are native from Tropical America (Berry and Kress, 1991), found at different altitudes, from sea level up to 2.000 meters in Central and South America, and up to 500 meters in the South Pacific Islands (Criley and Broschat, 1992).

Heliconia hybrids comprise many of the major cultivars as cut flowers, like H. psittacorum x H. spathocircinata cv. Golden Torch, cv. Golden Torch Adrian, cv. Alan Carle and H. caribaea x H. bihai cv. Carib Flame, cv. Jacquinii, cv. Richmond Red (Berry and Kress, 1991). Many heliconia species are identified through their morphological differences, such as the size and color of its flowers and bracts. These characteristics can be influenced either by geographic isolation or by environmental factors, such as light and nutrients (Kumar et al., 1998). H.

psittacorum clones, even when closely grown, can vary in blooming, size and color of bracts, as well as post harvest durability (Donselman and Broschat, 1986).

Agricultural Science

The natural variation among heliconia individuals or populations has led to taxonomic

identification doubts among farmers and researchers. Thus, genebanks have played an

important role in genetic diversity conservation, providing raw material for crop breeding, including landraces and their wild relatives. DNA markers, which allow the access to

variability at DNA level, emerge as an efficient alternative for plant species characterization by quantifying diversity and determining its genetic structure (Bruns et al., 1991).

The choice on which molecular marker technique shall be used depends on its

reproducibility and simplicity. Kumar et al. (1998) distinguished three cultivars of the hybrid H. psittacorum x H. spathocircinata cvs. Golden Torch, Red Torch and Alan Carle which showed only slight differences in RAPD markers profile from H. x nickeriensis Maas and de Rooij ( H. psittacorum x H. marginata), they also observed similarities in RAPD profiles and morphology. The authors concluded that two triploid H. psittacorum: cv. Iris and Petra, are supposed to be the same genotype.

Genetic diversity studies grew up in interest during the last years (Jatoi et al., 2008; Kladmook et al., 2010). As a result, nucleotide sequences of ribosomal genes (rDNA) and chloroplast genes (cpDNA) have been exploited to investigate several individuals of the Zingiberales

order (Kress, 1990, 1995; Kress et al., 2001) once they are not capable of lateral transfers and are not subject to the same functional limitations, they allow greater confidence in the results (Camara, 2008). The unit of ribosomal eukaryotic organisms consists of three genic and three non-genic regions. On one hand, the genic regions (18S, 5,8S and 26S) are conserved and

evolve slowly. On the other hand, non-genic regions, known as ITS - Internal Transcribed

Spacer (ITS-1 and ITS-2), evolve rapidly, showing high polymorphism and, therefore, allowing its use at higher hierarchical levels. The variability found in these regions could be the result of mutations in these areas, since they suffer less selection pressure and may be well used to study genetic diversity in plants (Bruns et al., 1991).

This molecular marker is important from the genetic variability assessment point of view, because the rDNA mutltigenic family once subjected to a rapid evolution in concert event, allows greater precision in the reconstruction process of the relationship between species based on sequencing, since this phenomenon increases the intragenomic uniformity

(Baldwin et al., 1995). These authors also affirm that due to the biparental inheritance of the nuclear genome it is possible to study the origin of hybrids and their parents. Moreover, chloroplast genes (cpDNA), such as the leucyn and fenilalanyn of RNA transporter ( trnL-trnF), the treonyn and leucyn of RNA transporter ( trnT-trnL) and the protein small 4 ( rps4), have been used successfully to solve genetic diversity doubts in taxonomic lower levels.

Johansen (2005), for example, studying the genetic diversity in Zingiberales order, using cpDNA, has positioned all Heliconiaceae and Musaceae within a same clade.

The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic diversity involving Heliconia psittacorum cultivars and interspecific hybrids of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco Heliconia Germplasm Collection (UFRPE-HCG), using nuclear and chloroplast DNA regions.

Agricultural Science

Molecular markers analyses occurred in the Plant Biotechnology Laboratory - UFRPE. The

optimization of the DNA extraction protocol was performed using fresh young leaves

samples of heliconia, harvested in the earliest stage of development and treated under three conditions: harvested, packed in a polystyrene box containing liquid nitrogen and taken to the Laboratory for immediate DNA extraction; harvested and frozen at -20°C for 1 day

before extraction; harvest and preserved in silica gel for 5 days before extraction.

In the DNA extraction, Doyle and Doyle (1990) protocol were used with modifications,

which was prepared at a 2x CTAB (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) buffer solution.

It was added 700 microliter extraction buffer to 200 mg of macerated leaves in test tubes and taken to bath at 65°C. The tubes, after cooled at room temperature, were centrifuged and the supernatant transferred to new tubes. Supernatant was added to 700 microliter (L) CIA

(Chloroform-Isoamyl Alcohol) and then centrifuged was performed.

The supernatant was added to 700 microliter (L) CIA (Chloroform-Isoamyl Alcohol) and

then centrifuged. After this process, supernatant was added to 500 L of cold isopropanol and stored for 24 hours in a freezer at -20ºC. Subsequently, it was washed twice with 70%

ethanol and with 95% ethanol. The precipitate was dried at room temperature for 20

minutes and then resuspended with 300 L TE containing RNAse, incubated at 37°C for 30

minutes, then 5M NaCl and 300 L of cooled isopropanol were added, in which the DNA

was precipitated. Solution was incubated at 4°C throughout the night and the pellet

resuspended in 300 L TE. The DNA was quantified in 0.8% agarose gel.

2.2 PCR amplification

The DNA amplification using PCR was performed to a final volume of 25 L containing 1

L template DNA, 0.3 L Taq-DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 2.51 L Tris-HCl (pH 8, 0), and

0.75 L MgCl2, 2 L of each dNTPs, 1 L primer, 1 L oligonucleotide 1 and 2; and 15.45 L

milli-Q water to complete the reaction.

Amplifications were performed in a thermocycler MJ Reseach, Inc., PTC100 under the

following conditions: step 1 - following a denaturation step of 95°C for 3 minutes; step 2 –

94°C for 1 minute; step 3 – 58°C for 1 minute for annealing temperature; step 4 – 72°C for 1

min (repeat steps 2/3/4 for 29 cycles) followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes and 10°C for 24h. The PCR product visualization was performed in 1.5% agarose gel stained with SYBER Gold (Invitrogen), visualized under ultraviolet light and recorded on a digital Vilber Lourmat photographer.

2.3 Statistical analysis

Through the interpretation of gels, molecular data were tabulated as presence (1) or absence (0) of DNA fragments by primers for each genotype. Genetic similarities among genotypes

were determined based on the Jaccard (1908) coefficients. A dendrogram was then

constructed using the unweighted pair-group method of the arithmetic average (UPGMA)

based on the similarity matrix. The cluster analyses were conducted using the computer

program Gene (Cruz, 2006).

3. Results

The best condition for heliconia DNA extraction was using leaves in the earlyest stage of development, harvested, packed in a polystyrene box containing liquid nitrogen and taken

to the Laboratory for immediate DNA extraction.

3.1 Primers selection

Primer combination ITS4-ITS3 resulted in most of the polymorphic band region, while for

the primer combination ITS4-ITS5 it was observed the least polymorphism. The primers

used amplified from 1 to 6 band regions, with clear polymorphism between the genotypes.

The amplifications of the nuclear region that includes the spacers ITS1-ITS2 and EF11-EF22

(Fig. 1) generated fragments of approximately 396 to 506 pb, which agrees with Baldwin et al. (1995), by claiming that ITS markers have numerous small sized copies, reaching up to 700 pb.

Chloroplast regions amplifications that used the primers tRNA of leucine and phenylalanine ( trnL-trnF) generated fragments of approximately 1636 pb (Fig. 2). For the spacers regions rps3' - rps5' as well as for the regions trnS-trnL and trnS-trnF, it was observed monomorphic and polymorphic band patterns for the evaluated cultivars and hybrids.

3.2 Internal transcribed spacers

From the data generated by ITS markers and the analysis of the dendrogram (Fig. 3), it was observed the formation of two main groups (GI and GII) well sustained. The GI group, is

constituted by Heliconia sp., while, the other, more representative, GII, is subdivided into two other subgroups, SG A and SG B.

used in this study, through ITS. G I= Group I; G II= Group II; SG A= Subgroup A; SG B=

Subgroup B.

The first group GI, consisting of Heliconia sp., that according to farmers, is identified as H.

psittacorum cv. Sassy and was more divergent from the other genotypes. The hypothesis that it is a new cultivar is supported by the fact that it was the only one that came from the state of Alagoas. It presents floral features intermediate between the triploid cultivars (Costa et al., 2008) of the subgroup SG A, bracts of pink and lilac, which presents individual characteristics such as, ovarian (OV) green distally and yellow green

proximally, pedicel (PD) yellow green and sepals (SE) orange with indistinct blackish

green area distally.

In the second group GII, subgroup SG A, formed by triploid cultivars of H. psittacorum: cvs.

Suriname Sassy and Sassy, that present bracts with pink and lilac, was also included

genotypes from the state of São Paulo, H. psittacorum cv. St Vincent Red and H. psittacorum cv. Lady Di.

The subgroup SG B was formed by the hybrid H. psittacorum x H. spathocircinata cvs. Golden Torch, Golden Torch Adrian and Red Opal, with bracts yellow and red. In this subgroup on

an external position, it was observed H. x nickeriensis, that is supposed to be an hybrid between H. psittacorum x H. marginata.

The hybrids showed low levels of similarity, around 12% of these comparisons reached

levels above 50% (Table 3), probably because they are the result from supposed crosses

between genetically distant parents or even the influences of epigenetic factors.

4. Discussion

It was not possible to obtain DNA with acceptable quality from Heliconia using the conventional methodology, as mentioned by Kumar et al. (1998), in an earlier study with molecular markers in heliconia.

4.1 Primers selection

Band patterns variation may be related to high occurrence rate of base substitution and the great possibility of indels accumulation (events of inserts and/or deletions of nucleotides), moreover, these sequences are difficult to identify (Albert et al., 2002). The study with a great number of genotypes aims to explain the inheritance of the chloroplast, which may

vary according to the subgenus and be useful for genetic diversity studies of the group.

These primers ( trnL-F) have been successfully used in genetic diversity analysis of Orchidaceae (Kocyan et al., 2004) and Bromeliaceae groups (Sousa et al., 2007).

4.2 Internal transcribed spacers

In the absence of more precise evidence, it was decided to keep the genotype, here called Heliconia sp., as a specie not yet identified. It is assumed as a new cultivar of H. psittacorum cv. Sassy that occurred due to different geographic conditions. In fact, this finding requires further studies. Other molecular markers can be used to solve this issue, as did Kumar et al.

(1998), that using RAPD, found that two triploid cultivars, Iris and Petra were the same

genotype. Sheela et al. (2006) by using RAPD, found that cvs. St Vincent Red and Lady Di, were also grouped in the same subgroup. Thus, assuming that these genotypes formed a

subgroup brother of triploid cultivars H. psittacorum cv. Sassy and cv. Suriname Sassy, presenting 2n = 36 (Costa et al., 2008), leads to the assumption that cvs. St Vincent Red and Lady Di are supposed to be triploid, corroborating with the similar banding pattern among these four genotypes in primer combination ITS3-ITS4.

The group that gathered the hybrids H. psittacorum x H. spathocircinata cvs. Golden Torch, Golden Torch Adrian and Red Opal was expected, once the nrDNA has biparental

inheritance, and it is a nuclear molecular marker. H. x nickeriensis belongs to the Heliconia subgenus and Pendulae section (Kress et al., 1993), this subdivision is based on the consistency of vegetative structure, and staminodes and style shape, especially in the

pending heliconia. H. marginata, alleged parent, has pending inflorescence, and yet, differ from other hybrids that are crosses between H. psittacorum x H. spathocircinata and belongs to the Stenochlamys subgenus and Stenochlamys section (Kress et al., 1993). Using RAPD markers to study genetic variability and relationship between 124 genotypes of the genus Heliconia, Marouelli et al. (2010), managed to gather interspecific hybrids of H. psittacorum in the same clade.

The hybrids showed small similarity that can be explained by the coevolution hypothesis,

which considers the great genetic diversity of the genotype in the center of origin, once in northeast Brazil is frequently encountered native populations of H. psittacorum. Moreover, there is a wide variety of H. psittacorum hybrids described in literature, especially H.

spathorcircinata, confirming the potential of this specie to form hybrids (Berry and Kress, 1991).

Agricultural Science

The influence of epigenetic factors in the phenotype of an organism and therefore in

obtaining hybrids of Heliconia should be an issue to be raised. Characteristics of the transmissibility of an individual to other generations are not only linked to genes, the cell should be considered with its cytoplasm, mitochondria and genetic material carried in its structure, as well as the organism as a whole, and the complexity of the environment

(Pearson, 2006). Another factor to be considered is the cytosine methylation of the genetic material, also responsible for gene silencing, causing changes in the phenotype, and

according to most recent works can be passed to subsequent generations, thus causing

greate genetic diversity among individuals of the same specie.

Routinely, new Heliconia species have been described and others have been included as synonyms on each revision of the genus or subgenus; but, there is still controversy among authors. This situation suggests the need for a careful review of this group, since the visual botanical identification, may lead to imprecise denomination for the species that are being cultivated.

Although some diversity studies about the Heliconiaceae family have been undertaken in

recent years, its classification remains opened, therefore, new genetic markers for the group are required to elucidate these classification issues. The results revealed that there was no repetition of genetic material among the cultivars and interspecific hybrids of H. psittacorum evaluated, indicating the necessity to use other regions that could provide potentially

informative characters. In conclusion, the genetic diversity nuclear and chloroplast DNA

regions observed to study in Heliconia psittacorum cultivars and interspecific hybrids, are information promising to be taken in account as a first step towards genetic improvement.

1. Introduction

1.1 Crop rotations – A historical perspective

Crop rotation is the production of different economically important plant species in

recurrent succession on a particular field or group of fields. It is an agricultural practice that has been followed at least since the Middle Ages. During the rule of Charlemagne crop

rotation was vital to much of Europe which at that time followed a two-field rotation of

seeding one field one year with a crop and leaving another fallow. The following year the fields were reversed (Butt, 2002). Sometime during the Carolingian period the three-field rotation system was introduced. It consisted of planting one field, usually with a winter cereal, a second with a summer annual legume, and leaving a third field fallow. The

following year a switch would occur. Sometime during the 17th and /or 18th centuries it was discovered that planting a legume in the field coming out of fallow of the three-field rotation would increase fodder for livestock and improve land quality, which was later found to be due to increased levels of available soil nitrogen (N). During the 16th century Charles

Townshend 2nd Viscount Townshend (aka Turnip Townshend) introduced the four-field

concept of crop rotation to the Waasland region of England (Ashton, 1948). This system,

which consisted of a root crop (turnips ( Brassica rapa var. rapa)), wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), and clover ( Trifolium spp.) followed by fallow. Every third year introduced a fodder crop and grazing crop into the system, allowing livestock

production the year-round and thus increased overall agriculture production. Our present day systems of crop rotation have their beginnings traceable to the Norfolk four-year

system, developed in Norfolk County England around 1730 (Martin, et al., 1976). This

system was similar to that developed by Townshend except barley followed turnips, clover

was seeded for the third year and finally wheat on the fourth year. The field would then be seeded to turnips again with no fallow year being part of the rotation.

In the new world, prior to the arrival of European settlers, the indigenous people in what is now the Northeastern United States, practiced slash-and-burn agriculture combined with

fishing, hunting, and gathering (Lyng, 2011). Fields were moved often as the soil would

become depleted and despite the tale of Native Americans teaching the European settlers to put a fish into the corn hills at planting, there is little or no evidence of the aboriginal people fertilizing their crops. Maize would be planted in hills using crude wooden hoes with

gourds and beans ( Phaseolus spp. L.) being planting alongside and allowed to climb the 26

Agricultural Science

maize stalks. When an area would become depleted of plant nutrients, it would be

abandoned and over time, would recover its natural fertility. Lyng (2011), describes the Native Americans of the northeast as not so much conscience ecologist but rather people

with a strong sense of dependences on nature minus the pressure to provide for consumer

demands. Plains Indians on the other hand are classified as being of two cultures. There were the nomadic nations that followed the herds of bison that roamed the region and lived mainly on a diet of bison meat and what they might gather in the way of wild berries, fruits, and nuts with very little farming except for some maize and tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum L.).

There were then the nations that lived on a combination of meat and crops they would raise.

These peoples tended to live in established villages and would fish, hunt, and gather wild fruit and berries. The crop farming they practiced again, were maize, beans, and squash

( Cucubina spp. L.), sometimes referred to as “The Three Sisters” in Native American society (Vivian, 2001). As with the nations in what would become the northeastern United States, the Plains Indians that practiced crop farming would usually clear their garden areas by

slash and burn, grow their crops, and then allow a two-year fallow before planting again.

Just prior to planting, some villages would carry in brush and other plant debris to burn along with the refuge that grew in the field during fallow to “enrich” the soil for the crops about to be planted.

The early European settlers attempted to raise those crops (wheat, and rye ( Secale cereal L.)) which they were accustom to, using cultivation methods they had used in the old country.

They also, introduced livestock, (cattle, swine, and sheep) which were not found in the New World but that had been a major source of food for them in their native homeland. They

soon discovered that clearing fields for planting and pasturing was an arduous task and in order to survive adopted some of the crop production techniques practiced by the

indigenous peoples and allowed their livestock to forage open-range (Lyng, 2011). As

colonization expanded and available labor increased along with the demand for food, the

permanent clearing of arable land increased along with the introduction of more Old World crops and, unfortunately, their pests that continue to demand time and financial resources to contain today.

The first export from the American colonies to England was tobacco. Though not a food

crop, tobacco played a pivotal role in helping sustain the Jamestown colony and gave the

settlers something to exchange for necessary items to survive. Tobacco is a high cash value, very labor intensive crop. Even as of 2002, with only about 57,000 total farms in the United States being classed as tobacco farms producing an average of 3 hectares of the crop per

farm, the average cash value of those 3 hectares was nearly $42,000 (Capehart, 2004).

Though tobacco preserved the Virginia colony, within seven years of its cultivation and

export, its continued production in the New World would usher in the African slave trade, the darkest part of America’s past, and would culminate 200 years later into the American Civil War.

Prior to colonization, a species of cotton, Gossypium barbadense, was being grown by the indigenous people of the New World (West, 2004). Columbus received gifts from the

Arawaks of balls of cotton thread upon making landfall in 1492. Egyptian cotton (G .

hirsutum L.) was introduced to the colonies as early as 1607 by the Virginia Company in an attempt to encourage its production and help satisfy the European appetite for the fiber that was currently being exported from India . However, tobacco production and the lucrative



Concepts in Crop Rotations

prices being paid for it along with the belief that cotton depleted the soil and required too much hand labor, dissuaded the colonist from planting the crop. Even encouragement from

the colonial Governors, William Berkley and Edmund Andors could not convince the

settlers to switch to cotton. Small hectarages of G. hirsutum L. though were grown along the Mid Atlantic colonies for individual household use. The Revolutionary War halted imports of large quantities of cotton to the former colonies from Britain and forced the Americans to grow their own supply. By the mid 1780’s production had expanded and the newly formed

United States became a net exporter of cotton to Britain.

After the development of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 the key to financial success in the southern states was acquiring large hectares of land for cotton production and large numbers of slaves to tend to the crop. Maize, small grains, forages, and food crops were grown only in sufficient quantities to sustain the plantations that had developed. These crops were not grown for the purpose of commerce and were often relegated to some of the

marginal lands on the plantation or near the homestead for convenient harvest. The bulk of all cleared fields were devoted to production of tobacco or “King Cotton” as it would

become known. From 1800 to 1830 cotton went from making up 7% ($5 million) of exports

from the United States to 41% ($30 million) (West, 2004). Tobacco production went from

45.4 million kg at the outbreak of the Revolutionary War to 175.8 million kg prior to the Civil War (Jacobstein, 1907). Crop rotation was not even considered an option with respect to these crops due to the cash value paid for them. By 1835 the top soil of eastern Georgia had eroded away with the remaining clay unsuitable for cotton production. As soils became depleted of nutrients necessary for the crops’ production, more wilderness, particularly

further west would be cleared and farmed. This resulted in conflicts with the native peoples that resulted in their forced resettlement onto reservations and the spread of slavery

westward into newly chartered states in the south. This further deepened political and

economic conflicts that would explode into the American Civil War.

1.2 Advent of agricultural education and research

The Morrill Act of 1862 and again 1892 established the American Land-Grant colleges in

each state and charged them with the responsibility of teaching the agricultural and

mechanical disciplines, along with other responsibilities necessary to an advanced

education. The Hatch Act of 1887 then established the Agriculture Experiment Station

system which, in most states, is administered by the Land-Grant Universities and was to

provide further enhancement of agricultural teaching through experimentation. In 1914 the Smith-Lever Act established the State Cooperative Extension Service which disseminates

information to the public of advances in agriculture production discovered by the state

agricultural experiment stations. All three of these legislative acts came about because of a need to better understand sound farm management practices, including crop rotations, to

improve the nation’s farm economy.

The concept of agriculture research stations was not an American idea. The Rothamsted

Experiment Station in the United Kingdom is said to be the world’s oldest, being established in 1843, while Möcken station in Germany, established in 1850, is said to be the world’s

oldest state supported agricultural research station. Agricultural research stations can now be found in most all developed countries and even many less developed nations. Research

on crop rotations has been and continues to be conducted at virtually all of these stations, 28

Agricultural Science

with specialization towards the environment and crop species indigenous to their location.

Some of these studies have been in existence since the late 19th century (Rothamsted, 2011).

Some of the more famous experiments in the United States that continue to be performed at some of the Land-Grant Universities, and are now designated on the National Register of

Historic Places, include The Old Rotation experiment on the Auburn University campus in Alabama, The Morrow Plots on the campus of the University of Illinois, and Sanborn Field at the University of Missouri. Mitchell et al., (2008) published that the Old Rotation experiment in Alabama has shown over the long-term, seeding winter legumes were as effective as fertilizer N

in producing high cotton lint yields and increasing soil organic C levels. Rotation schemes with corn or with corn-winter wheat- and soybean ( Glycine max L. Merr.) produced no yield advantage beyond that associated with soil organic C (Table 1). However, winter legumes and crop rotations contributed to increased soil organic matter and did result in higher lint yields.

‡Recent data show the effect of increasing soil organic matter on cotton productivity.

Table 1. Long-term effects of crop rotations, winter legumes and nitrogen fertilizer on cotton lint yields at the “Old Rotation Experiment” of Auburn University in Alabama. (Mitchell, 2004).

Data from the Morrow Plots in Illinois have shown that yields from continuous corn have

always been much less than corn yields from a of corn-oats ( Avena sativa L.) rotation or a or corn-oats-and hay (clover ( Trifolium spp.) or alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.)) rotation (Aref and Wander, 1998). After the introduction of hybrid corn varieties in 1937, the first plots to show an increase in corn yields due to these varieties were the corn-oats-hay rotation. Yield increases due to hybrids were not noticed in the corn-oat plots until the late 1940’s and in the continuous corn plots until the early 1950’s. These lower corn yields of the continuous corn and the slower response to corn hybridization in the corn-oat rotation appear to

coincide with long-term average levels of soil organic matter and nitrogen observed in the various plots (Table 2).

Corn and wheat yields at Sanborn Field at the University of Missouri have been consistently higher when grown in rotation with each other along with red clover ( Trifolium pratense L.) inter-seeded into the wheat in late winter for forage the following year (Miles, 1999). Plots of both corn and wheat have been grown continuously since the site’s establishment in 1888, some receiving animal manure, some commercial fertilizer, and some no fertility treatment.

All have had reduced grain yields compared to those grown in rotation, even with the

added manure and/or fertilizer.

Thirty years after Sanborn Field’s establishment, its focus began to shift to the study of cropping systems as related to soil erosion and the resulting loss of productivity. An

experiment conducted in 1917 by F.L. Duley and M.F. Miller on the campus of the

University of Missouri used seven test plots to measure soil erosion resulting from rainfall (Duley and Miller, 1923). This research led to creation of the Soil Conservation Service of the USDA, which in now a component of NRCS-USDA. It led to the establishment of

experiment stations throughout the United States dedicated to the study of crop rotations on soil erosion and developing cropping systems to minimize erosion’s impact (Weaver and

Noll, 1935). Experiments at these stations in Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas all showed plots planted to a continuous cropping system had higher surface soil losses and

losses of rainfall than plots planted to a forage or in a three or four year rotation (Uhland, 1948).

2. Crop rotations vs. continuous cropping

Crop rotation schemes are, by and large, regional in nature and a specific rotation in one environment may not be applicable in another. Continuous cropping schemes or

monocultures for the most part, have fallen out of favor in many farming regions. Roth

(1996) published mean corn yields from a 20 year crop rotation experiment in Pennsylvania that included rotation with both soybean and alfalfa showing higher yields with all rotation schemes than continuous corn (Table 3). The extensive use of commercial fertilizers and

pesticides has helped mask most of the beneficial effects of crop rotation. But Karlen et al.

(1994) has stated” no amount of chemical fertilizer or pesticide can be fully compensated for crop rotation effects”. However, economics continues to be the large determining factor into how a field is managed.

One primary benefit to crop rotation is the breaking of crop pest cycles. Roth (1996) states that in Pennsylvania, crop rotations help control several of the crop-disease problems

common to the area such as gray leaf spot in corn ( Cercospora zeae-maydis) take-all in wheat ( Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici), and sclerotina in soybean ( Sclerotinia sclerotiorum). In corn, corn rootworms ( Diabrotica virgifera spp.) can be a devastating pest and crop rotation was considered to be the most effect method of control. However, beginning in the late 1980’s there was a variant of the Western corn root worm (D. virgifera virgifera LeConte) that began egg laying in soybean fields, making larvae present to feed upon first year corn in a soybean-corn rotation (Hammond et al., 2009). Prior to this time the standard method to

avoiding rootworm damage was to rotate. However, during the mid-1960’s in the Cornbelt

there was a movement to engage in growing corn continuously on highly productive soils.

Atrazine [2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine] was being readily adopted for weed control in corn and a number of insecticides were becoming available for of control corn rootworm and other corn insects. Also sources of nitrogen fertilizer were readily

available and relatively inexpensive. Competitive profits for other crops, particularly

soybean, and continued research showing tangible benefits to rotations though returned

most fields to some sort of rotation scheme. However, there are some producers today who are profitable at growing continuous corn. But, such a system appears to require strict

adherence to sound management practices.

Cotton is probably the principle crop that has been grown continuously on many fields,

some for over 100 years. The crop was profitable and well suited for production in areas prone to hot summer temperatures and limited rainfall. There was also an infrastructure

available in these production regions for processing the lint and seed as well as a social bond that connected the crop to the people who grew it. Corn, hay, and small grains were the “step children” of agronomic crops for generations of southern planters. Corn and

winter oats were grown in the Cottonbelt solely as feed grains for the draft animals used to grow cotton and the meat and dairy animals grown for home consumption. There were

basically no markets available or facilities to handle some of these crops for commercial trade. Despite being introduced in the 1930’s, it wasn’t until the early 1950’s that soybean became an important crop in the lower Mississippi River Valley (Bowman, 1986). Rice

( Oryza sativa L.) was introduced to the Mississippi River Delta in 1948 and together these crops provided alternative sources of agronomic income to cotton but did little to encourage crop rotation. Both rice and soybean were relegated to the heavier clay soils of the

Mississippi Delta with the sandy loams, silts, and silty clays remaining in cotton. It wasn’t Concepts in Crop Rotations

31

until changes in government support programs in the mid-1990’s that planters in the Mid

South became interested in alternatives to continuous cotton and began to produce corn for commercial sale and rotate it with cotton. Corn hectareage in the states of Arkansas,

Louisiana, and Mississippi increased from 161,000 ha in 1990, to 382,000 ha in 2000, to

630,000 ha in 2010 (USDA-NASS, 2011).

Until 2007 research information about corn-cotton rotations were limited. An extensive

study on various corn-cotton rotation schemes yielded data on the effects of rotation on

yields and reniform nematode ( Rotylenchulus reniformis) a serious pest to cotton. Bruns, et al.

(2007), reported corn grain yields were greater following cotton than in plots of continuous corn. Pettigrew, et al. (2007), noted that cotton plant height increased 10% in plots following one year of corn and 13% following two years of corn when compared to continuous cotton

(Table 4). Lint yields increased 13% following two years of corn primarily due to a 13% in bolls per m2. No other increases were noted however. Stetina, et al., (2007) found that following two years of corn production, reniform nematode populations remained below

damaging levels to the cotton plants. However, cotton following just one year of corn

would have reniform nematode populations rebound to damaging levels towards the end of

the growing season.

3. Rice production and crop rotation

Rice ranks third behind corn and wheat in total tons of grain produced in the world but it is the primary dietary staple for more people than any other cereal (Raun and Johnson, 1999).

It is grown on every continent except Antarctica. By the 1990’s rice was providing 35% to 59% of the total calories consumed by nearly 2.7 billion people in Asia (Neue, 1993). Peng et al. (1999) quoted that world rice production would need to be at least 600 million tons by 2025, an increase of 266 million tons above 1995 production just to maintain current

nutrition levels. This increase will likely not be sufficient to alleviate current malnutrition in many of the rice dependent cultures (Neue, 1993). In areas where it is virtually the sole source of calories it is seldom grown in rotation with other crops. Anders, et al., (2004) 32

Agricultural Science

stated that producers growing continuous rice will likely experience lower grain yields than those using a rice-soybean rotation.

A common rotation with rice in southern and eastern Asia is a rice-wheat rotation system that occupies an estimated 24 to 27 million hectares (Wassmann, et al., 2004). Lattimore (1994) reviewed the literature pertaining to rice-pasture rotations in southeastern Australia. Annual pastures based on subterranean clover ( Trifolium subterraneum L.) are well adapted to this part of the world and the rice cropping system. It provides considerable fixed N to the rice crop thus reducing the need level of supplemental N fertilizer as well as breaking weed cycles. It helps sustain a complimentary animal agriculture to use crop residues and provides

opportunities for improved farm income. With respect to disease control in rice, both false smut ( Ustilaginoidea virens (Cooke) Takah) and kernel smut ( Neovossia horrid a (Takah.) Padwick

& A. Khan, syn. Tilletia barclayana (Bref.) Sacc. & P. Syd.) two serious fungal pests in rice production areas of the United States, appear to be best controlled when rice is grown in three year rotations with soybean and corn between rice crops (Brooks, 2011). Traditional rotations of rice-soybean, with winter wheat grown between the two summer annuals, were observed to have the highest levels of these diseases especially with high N- fertility levels.

4. The corn-soybean rotation

One of the more widely practiced rotations in the United States involves the corn-soybean rotation scheme used extensively in the North Central and Mid-Atlantic States. Within the 20 year period between 1988 and 2008 nearly 30 publications were known to have been

published that compared corn-soybean rotations to continuous corn (Erickson, 2008).

Virtually all of this research showed increases in corn grain yields from plots that had been planted to soybean the previous year. A few of these experiments followed soybean with

two years of corn and in those studies yields from the second year corn crop were equal to or still greater than those from plots of continuous corn but less than the first year corn crop.

One of these studies (Porter et al., 1997) examined the effects of various corn-soybean

rotation schemes at three locations in the northern Corn Belt. Data from these studies

showed that not only were both corn and soybean yields higher in rotation compared to

monocultures of the two crops (Table 5), but that differences between rotations and

monocultures were greater in low-yielding environments than in high-yielding conditions.

Studying the net returns of various crop rotation schemes involving corn, Singer and Cox

(1998) calculated a greater net return ($250 US ha-1) with a corn-soybean rotation than a continuous corn ($193 US ha-1) or a three year soybean-wheat/red clover rotation ($133 US

ha-1). A recent study reported though, that yield comparisons are not the appropriate basis for decision making on cropping systems but rather economics is most important (Stanger et al., 2008). This report showed that, with the exception of continuous corn grown with 224

kg N ha-1, a corn-soybean rotation was the most stochastically efficient cropping system

across a range of N fertility treatments and other rotation schemes.

4.1 Other soybean rotations

Though soybean is one of humankind’s oldest crops, it did not really become of significance in the United States until the late 1940’s. The species was introduced in Europe from China in the mid 18th century and into the new world in the early 19th century where it was used primarily as a hay crop. The combination of the destruction in China from World War II

and the Cultural Revolution removed it as the world’s primary supplier of soybeans and

opened an opportunity for the United States to develop the crop as a major oil seed (North Carolina Soybean Producers Assn. , 2011). Currently the United States produces about 40%

of the world’s soybeans followed by Brazil and Argentina combining to produce 50%.

Besides corn, soybean is being rotated with rice or cotton in the Mid South and Southeastern States (Anders et al., 2004: Stallcup, 2009). In the eastern Great Plains soybean is often rotated with wheat or grain sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) as well as corn (Kelley et al., 2003). Kelley et al. (2003), found that in general soybean yields grown in rotations with wheat or grain sorghum produced a 16% greater seed yield than when grown in a

monoculture (Table 6). One of these rotations was soybean double-cropped behind winter

wheat which is frequently practiced in areas of the United States south of 39o N latitude.

This practice does risk failure from drought either causing poor emergence or poor seed set.

Above 39o N there is also the risk of early frost terminating growth and above 40o N the

practice of double-crop soybean after wheat is not advisable.

5. Rotations for forage crops

Prior to the extensive production of soybean for seed in the United States, and important rotation scheme in much of the New England, Mid-Atlantic and North Central states was

corn-winter wheat-red clover. Frequently the red clover would be over seeded in late

winter or early spring in the developing wheat crop. Many times timothy ( Phleum pretense L.) a cool-season perennial grass would be seeded along with the red clover. The mixture 34

Agricultural Science

would provide some pasture or hay the first year after the wheat was harvested but was

most productive the following year. The two species combined will provide more forage

production together than each species separately (Martin and Leonard, 1967). These fields would frequently then be plowed in fall or spring of the second year with the sward providing a green manure crop for the following season. Sometimes only red clover would

be over seeded in the wheat solely for the purpose of being used as a green manure crop.

Other grass species would occasionally be seeded with the red clover and sometimes the

field would remain in red clover-grass for two or more years to provide hay and grazing.

Though this rotation is comparatively old, it is still practiced, especially where there are numerous beef cow-calf, dairy, or horse enterprises.

Both beef and dairy cattle farming involves crop management challenges that many tend to

overlook when thinking about crop rotations. Many people do not think of pasture swards

as being a “crop”. But to the cattleman it is a very important source of income and deserves as much attention to management as any other economic plant life. Dairy farms are very

dependent on careful management of feed and forage resources in order to be sustainable.

Not only is the quantity of feed and forage important to the dairy animal but quality as well, to insure maximum milk production during lactation. Roth et al., (1997), list a number of suggestions to aid dairy farmers in developing long term crop rotation plans that address production issues, such as feed quantities, forage quality, fertility, and pest control issues as it relates to corn silage production. Greater restrictions on pesticide use, are often placed on dairy operations due to concerns over traces of some chemicals carrying over into milk that is consumed by children. Continuous corn silage production carries the risk of corn

rootworm damage, and as pointed out earlier, the western corn rootworm has adapted to

egg laying in soybean fields and can damage corn following soybean. Roth (1996) points

out that western corn rootworm larvae cannot tolerate a rotation to alfalfa. Therefore,

seeding alfalfa after corn for silage will not only provide a good source of quality hay but also eliminate the need for a soil insecticide for rootworm control in the following corn crop.

Temporary meadows, which are seeded into a forage species for one to three years and then cultivated for a grain crop are sometimes included in discussions regarding crop rotations.

However, a number of dairy farms and beef cow-calf operations occur in areas that include land unsuitable for tillage of any kind and are often used as permanent pastures that should be managed with the same intensity as any other cropland. Without proper attention these areas will often revert to a high proportion of weedy or woody species that are not useable by

livestock and low yielding forage that reduces the pasture’s carrying capacity or places greater demands on tillable cropland to provide necessary feed to maintain the animal enterprise.

Johnson et al., (2007) states that periodic renovation or “renewing” of a pasture is the best way to improve forage yield and animal performance. Pasture renovation is in a way a form of crop rotation if you consider crop rotation as a means of maintaining land productivity. In temperate climates renovation usually begins in the fall by overgrazing the pasture to be renovated to remove excess vegetative material that might interfere with seeding and

germination of the new pasture mix ( Johnson et al., 2007; Lacefield and Smith, 2009). Seeding usually occurs in mid-winter while the soil is frozen in the first few centimeters. The thawing and refreezing of the soil surface is usually sufficient to allow good contact of the forage seed with the soil for germination. Sometimes a light cultivation with a disk or spike-toothed harrow is done to improve the chances of a good soil-seed contact.



Concepts in Crop Rotations

35

Soil tests are usually acquired prior to seeding to determine nutrient availability.

Applications of pulverized limestone are often required to supply Ca and adjust pH levels to facilitate establishment of a forage legume. Many soils in temperate climates tend to be acidic (pH 4.5 to 5.5) and require liming to elevate soil pH levels to 5.7 or higher to be more suitable for legume establishment. Virtually all recommendations for pasture renovation in temperate climates call for the establishment of one or two legumes in the sward (Wheaton and Roberts, 1993; Johnson et al., 2007; Lacefield and Smith, 2009; Teusch and Fike, 2009).

Wheaton and Roberts (1993) listed 10 benefits of including a forage legume in a pasture mix.

Among them were an increase in animal gain, decrease in herd health problems, an

increased conception rate by cows, an increased protein yield per hectare, N being furnished by the legume to the grass, and reduced pasture production costs. Johnson et al., (2007) stated some of the same benefits along with a better seasonal distribution of forage because legumes are generally more productive in mid-summer than cool-season grasses which are

the more common grass types grown in temperate climates. Lacefield and Smith (2009),

reported that tall fescue ( Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) growing in conjunction with red clover seeded at 6.7 kg ha-1 yielded more dry matter (12,400 kg ha-1) than fescue alone fertilized with 202 kg N ha-1 (11,100 kg ha-1). Teusch and Fike (2009) list several legume species to be considered for seeding in pasture renovation. The more common legume species

recommended are red clover, ladino clover ( Trifolum repens L.), annual lespedeza ( Lespedeza striata Maxim.), alfalfa, and birdsfoot trefoil ( Lotus corniculatus Cav.). As stated previously, in temperate climates cool season grass species are frequently selected to be seeded along with the legume when renovating pastures. For permanent pastures the species of choice

are often tall fescue, orchard grass ( Dactylis glomerata L.), or smooth brome ( Bromus inermis L.). Pasture management is an on-going operation and additional seedings may be

necessary to maintain a profitable sward. Birdsfoot trefoil has the ability to reseed itself even under grazing and alfalfa is a long-lived legume with individual plants able to survive up to five years. Red clover, though a perennial, will usually last only about three years and will need to be reseeded. Some forage specialists have found that over-seeding the pasture annually with 4.5 kg ha-1 of red clover seed in mid-winter will maintain the sward at about 30% legume which is recommended as the proper mix of grass and legume (H.N. Wheaton,

1975, personal communication). Even with good management, most pastures will need

renovation about ever four to five years due to weed growth.

Pasture renovation in sub-tropical climates usually involves complete destruction of the old sward and reseeding or sprigging to reestablish the grass. The reasons or renovation in the sub-tropics are usually for weed control, or to reestablish swards lost to insects, over

grazing, prolonged drought and in some cases multiple freezes during late winter that kill off the grasses. Renovation may also be done to replace an older grass cultivar with a newer more productive one (Woodruff et al., 2010). One basic difference between temperate

pasture renovation and sub-tropical pastures is that in the sub-tropics the old sward is

essentially destroyed and a new one established (Verdramini et al., 2010). Sub-tropical

pastures are not as apt to include a forage legume due to most of those species being cool-season and may not survive well in hot humid summer months. Also, many of the grass

species used are aggressive in nature and effective at crowding out less aggressive species.

The more common species grown as pasture grasses in the subtropics are hybrid

bermudagrass ( Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.), bahiagrass ( Paspalum notatum), atra paspalum ( Paspalum atratum Swallen), digitgrass ( Digitaria decumbens) (En), limpograss ( Hemarthria 36

Agricultural Science

altissima), and Rhodes grass ( Chloris gayana (Kunth)) (Verdramini et al., 2010). All of these grasses except atra paspalum, bahiagrass and Rhodes grass require vegetative propagation

in order to be established. As with temperate pastures, the pasture must first be properly prepared by controlling weeds, insects, removing old or dead vegetative material and

fertilizing to soil test recommendations. Burning is often used in preparing bermudagrass pastures for renovation (Stichler and Bade, 2005). Tillage operations are often performed during dry periods in the spring to further control weeds and old sward growth as well as better prepare the land for vegetative propagation with the onset of summer rains (Stichler and Bade, 2005;Verdramini et al., 2010). In both the subtropical and temperate climates

warm season annual forages may be included into crop rotations on land used primarily for cultivated crops. This is to provide additional pasture, hay or silage for livestock

operations. Species such as pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.), sudangrass

(Sorghum bicolor subsp. Drummondii (Steud.) de Wet ex Davidse), and other forage sorghum and sorghum x sudangrass crosses often fill this role (Hancock, 2009).

6. Summer fallow

Summer fallow, the practice of growing a crop every other year and in most systems,

controlling weed growth during the off-year, has been used almost exclusive in semi-arid

regions for the production of wheat or other small grains. Its purpose is to accumulate

sufficient limited rainfall during the fallow year to grow a crop the following year and to break crop disease cycles. Most of the world’s drylands are in developing countries where water resources are usually limited by a lack of rainfall and potential irrigation (Ryan et al., 2008). Stewart et al. (2006) has stated that dry regions worldwide supply about 60% of

human food stuffs. Areas where this is a common practice are the Mediterranean, semiarid regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, the Pacific Northwestern United States, and the western regions of the Canadian and United States Great Plains. Many of these areas practice a

“clean” summer fallow where the land is kept weed free during the fallow year, usually by cultivation or herbicides. However, in northern Africa a weedy fallow is often employed

where palatable weeds and volunteer crop plants are allowed to grow and then be grazed

by livestock (Ryan et al., 2008). This allows for an animal agriculture to exist that provides needed calories and returns manure to the land to provide nutrients for the following crop.

In semiarid areas of the Pacific Northwestern United States summer fallow wheat

production has been practiced nearly 130 years (Schillinger et al., 2007). In recent years though, studies have been conducted in semiarid regions of the United States and Canada to adapt a continuous cropping system to replace summer fallow. Water storage efficiency in most summer fallow-wheat rotations is usually less than 25% of the rainfall received during a 14 month period using conventional tillage (McGee et al., 1997). Research from Colorado and Nebraska demonstrated that precipitation storage efficiency could be improved to 40%

to 60% through minimum or no-till which allows crop residue to remain on the soil surface and soil disturbance is held to a minimum or eliminated (Croissant et al., 2008). However, such practices added little or no increase in wheat yields and it was concluded that the

resultant water savings could only be converted to profit by employing intensive cropping systems where fallow time is decreased and summer crops such as maize, grain sorghum, or

annual forages and included in the rotation. Under no-till it was determined that it cost more to save the additional water than the value of the added grain yield. Lyon et al. (2004) Concepts in Crop Rotations

37

reported that winter wheat yields in the central Great Plains were negatively affected by eliminating the 11 to 14 month summer fallow by spring planting a transitional crop before wheat in the fall. However, a spring planted forage crop that was harvested early had a

minimum negative impact on wheat yields and that the value of the forage combined with

the following wheat yields resulted in greater income than the traditional winter wheat-

fallow rotation. Research from the Horse Heaven Hills region of Washington looked at a

continuous no-till hard red spring wheat system verses a winter wheat-fallow rotation and found the hard red spring no-till system did not match the winter wheat-fallow system of

production in yield or income. However, the continuous no-till system did offer a benefit of providing ground cover that reduced wind erosion and air pollution by dust particles

(Young et al., 2000).

Summer fallow is also practiced on fields used to produce castor bean ( Ricinus communis L.) the previous year. This is not done for accumulating moisture but to rid the field of any volunteer plants. Castor bean contains a very deadly toxin, ricin, which in very small quantities can kill humans and livestock. Summer fallow in this case allows volunteer

plants to be destroyed and the field cleaned for future feed and food crops.

7. Organic farming and crop rotations

Organic farming has embraced crop rotations as its backbone to success. Crop rotation is practiced with what appears to be, much more intensity than most conventional farming

systems with particular emphasis on sustainability. A crop rotation plan and accompanying records for a field and/or farm are required for certification as an organic farming operation (Johnson and Toensmeier, 2009). Organic farming and its use of crop rotations could be

summed up in part, as the employment of proven crop management practices prior to the

advent of pesticides and processed fertilizers. This is not to say that improvements on those rotation systems have not occurred. Most have been modified to accommodate

mechanization and most other time saving ideas. But, yields may be lower. Maeder et al., (2002) reported on a 21 year study in Europe that crop yields on organic farms were

generally 20% lower. However, there was an offsetting decrease of 34% in fertilizer expense, a 53% reduction in energy costs, and a 97% decrease in pesticides. Reganold et al., (1987) reported a comparison of the long-term effects (40 years) of conventional farming to organic systems found that organic farms had significantly higher levels of soil organic matter than conventional systems, greater top soil depth, higher polysaccharide content, and less soil erosion. Clark et al., (1998) reported that over an eight year period of applying organic crop rotation practices that soil organic matter had increased 2% over a comparable field that used conventional practices in a two-year rotation scheme.

A major challenge to organic crop production is control of weeds. Weed management has

been identified by producers as the principle problem in organic farming (Walz, 1999). The advent and subsequent extensive use of herbicides after World War II altered crop

production practices, especially crop rotations. Conventional crop farming today usually involves two- or three-crop crop rotations as have been previously mentioned with a heavy reliance on herbicides to at least reduce or eliminate weed problems. Regardless of the type of farming system used, conventional or organic, weeds are a constant annual drag on

achieving maximum yields of high quality produce. Nave and Wax (1971) reported a

reduction in soybean seed yields of between 25% to 30% compared to weed free plots due to 38

Agricultural Science

the presence of one smooth pigweed ( Amaranthus hybridus L.) per 30 cm of row and that yield losses from stubble, lodging and stalks were more than double in pigweed and giant

foxtail ( Setaria fabric Herrm.) infested plots compared to weed free plots. Weeds compete with a crop for water, light, and soil nutrients directly reduce yields. Some species have alleopathnogenic effects upon certain crops, reducing their growth and yield or in extreme cases causing their death. Weeds can harbor insect pests or serve as alternate hosts to plant diseases that further reduce yields and produce quality. They can add off-flavors to crop products or in some cases provide toxins to produce, rendering it unhealthy to consume.

Weeds present during harvest can also damage the crop being harvested. Ellis et al., (1998) reported increases in damaged soybean seeds by 8.2% to 11.1% with the presences of a plant per m of row of any of five common weed species found in the Mid South. In organic

farming, crop rotations are vital to controlling weed growth. Teasdale et al., (2004)

evaluated the weed seed dynamics of three organic crop rotations and found that seedbanks of smooth pigweed and common lambsquarter ( Chenopodium album L.) were usually lower following a hay sward in a four-year rotation or wheat in a three-year rotation than

following soybean in a two-year rotation prior to being planted to corn. However, annual grassy weed seedbanks prior to corn planting were generally higher following the hay

sward of the four-year rotation than the wheat of three-year rotation or the soybean of the two-year rotation. Porter et al., (2003) also found that weed control in organic corn and soybean were better when they were part of a four-year rotation of corn-soybean-oat-alfalfa compared to a two-year corn-soybean scheme.

Nitrogen is probably the most important of the macro-nutrients in crop production.

Libraries at all major agricultural universities have a seemingly endless supply of research articles and texts pointing out the importance of adequate N-fertility in the growth and

development of every crop important to humankind. In organic crop farming, and

increasingly in conventional cropping systems, the use of crop rotations that supply ample supplies of N to non-leguminous cereals is an important management strategy. Prior to the escalating energy prices and the increasing cost of manufactured N-fertilizer sources, the use of legumes that fix atmospheric N by Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, especially clover species, as green manures or cover crops had diminished sharply. Even prior to World War I legumes would almost always be seeded for a green manure crop preceding corn (Heichel

and Barnes, 1984). In organic farming, where the emphasis is to refrain from using

manufactured N-fertilizer, green manure crops or cover crops are a vital source of N for

much of their production. Lupwayi et al., (1998) reported that microbial diversity was

greater under wheat preceded by red clover manure or field peas ( Pisum sativum L.) than under continuous wheat. Long-term crop rotation research in Iowa has shown very little or no increase in corn yields from plots receiving N-fertilizer compared to those following one or two years of an alfalfa- bromegrass- red clover meadow (Voss and Shrader, 1984).

Species selection for organic crop rotations is probably more thought out than for

conventional crop rotations. As explained earlier, conventional crop rotations are heavily influenced by market price of the various commodities available to be grown. Though

commodity price is important to practitioners of organic farming it is not the primary

driving force in making species selections. Baldwin (2006) states that organic farmers face the challenge of practicing crop rotations by defining systems that maintain farm profits while improving soil quality and preserving the environment. Frequently organic farmers

will develop rotation schemes and select species based upon the crop’s ability to extract nutrients and water from the soil. Some organic producers include vegetable crops into

their operations due to these species tendency to extract nutrients and water from shallow depths then follow with a cereal that generally feeds to greater soil depths. Species selection is also made on the basis of weed, insect, and disease control. Delate and Hartzler (2003), states that rye has allopathic properties and is often used as a winter cover crop following corn to aid in weed control in preceding soybean or oat crops. Sustainability through the natural preservation of soil fertility is paramount to the organic farmer and makes the

selection of species an important part of the operation. Organic crop production makes as much use of natural pest control, including crop rotations, as is possible.

8. Biofuels production and crop rotations

Interest in using lignocellulosic biomass to produce ethanol is gaining in popularity.

Lignocellulosic biomass production mainly involves growing and harvesting plants

generally not used for food or feed. Woody species such as willow ( Salix. spp.) and poplars ( Populus spp.) (Matthew et al., 2010) and grasses such as switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum), big bluestem ( Andropogon gerardii), reed canarygrass ( Phalaris arundinacea) are several sources of lignocellulosic biomass that have shown to be useful in ethanol production (Hill, 2007).

Rotation schemes for growing lignocellulocsic crops are, for the most part, still in

development. Production of these materials for biofuels though is being done mostly on

land not suitable for extensive corn and soybean production thus relieving pressure to grow more hectares of these crops to satisfy the conventional and biofuels markets. Worldwide it is estimated that about 1% of crop land or about 11-12 million hectares are being used to grow biofuels (de Fraiture et al., 2008). Raghu et al., (2006) points out that some of the traits favorable to producing a lignocellulosic crop such as being a C4 photosynthetically, lacking pests, rapid early season growth, and long canopy duration can also tend towards them

being invasive. This would not work well in a rotation scheme with most conventional

crops. Currently lignocellulosic crops contribute little to current U.S. transportation biofuel suppliers but will likely provide the great share of ethanol in the near future.

In the United States, debate is underway concerning the use of corn as a primary source of fuel ethanol. Also, soybean oil is being blended with diesel to extend it. Diversion of these crops for biofuels is believed to increase food prices for consumers as the competing interest of food and fuel vie for the available supply. There is also concern that the increased

demands for these grains will negatively impact crop rotations, particularly those that help conserve soil, water, and plant nutrients. One of the primary reasons corn and soybean are currently popular for biofuels over lignocellulosic crops is the comparatively short time to harvest maturity. Most of the lignocellulosic crops require three to five years to reach harvest maturity(Hill, 2007), compared to one year for corn or soybean. Though corn and

soybean are regularly rotated with one another, history has shown that a substantial

increase in the price received for any crop can encourage monocultures at the expense of

proven rotations and their accompanying benefits. The expanded use of corn and soybean

as biofuel could diminish the inclusion of small grains and/or forage crops in rotation

schemes and the tillage of soils that are not well suited for cultivation.

Besides lignocellulosic crops, the harvesting of crop residues for ethanol production has been considered. Perlack et al., (2006) has reported that nearly 7.0 X 1010 kg of corn stover 40

Agricultural Science

could be harvested in the U.S. for ethanol production. Worldwide other crops that produce sufficient quantities of residue that could be used to produce ethanol include rice, barley, oat, wheat, sorghum, and sugar cane ( Saccharum officinarum L.). The use of crop residues for lignocellulosic ethanol production has however run into opposition due to the negative

impacts such removals have on C sequestration, soil properties, and nutrient availability for subsequent crops. Wilhelm et al., (2007) reported that between 5.25 and 12.50 Mg ha-1 of corn stover are required to maintain soil C at productive levels for subsequent crops. Lal (2004) states that even though the energy acquired from the world’s crop residue would be equivalent to 7.5 billion barrels of diesel, a 30% to 40% removal of crop residue would

increase soil erosion and its subsequent pollution hazards, deplete soil organic C, and

increase CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions from the soil. He suggests establishing

biofuel plantations of adapted species on marginal lands rather than remove crop residues from land used to grow food and feed grains. Development of such plantations will require more aggressive research into developing crop rotation schemes specific for growing

lignocellulosic crops for biofuel.

9. Conservation tillage

Conservation tillage continues to grow in importance in crop production since its inception over 40 years ago. C.M. Woodruff in 1970 was conducting research on strip-planting corn

into tall fescue sod on Missouri hillsides with the idea of producing a cash grain/feed crop along with a forage crop for livestock production while maximizing conservation of the soil and rain water (Anonymous, 1970). Anders et al., (2004) found that phosphorus (P)

concentrations in run-off water were higher for no-till rice than conventional tilled paddies, most likely due to the P being surface applied. However, total-P concentrations in run-off were lower in no-till because of the reduced loss of soil in no-till and its bound P.

Conservation tillage which includes both minimum tillage and no-till practices, are used to grow an array of crops from corn, soybean, cotton, grain sorghum, and several small grain species almost always in some rotation scheme. It is popular not only for the conservation of natural resources as just mentioned, but also for the savings in fuel, time, wear and tear on farm equipment, and the environmentally sustainable attributes of the various practices.

Minimum tillage, by reduced soil disturbance, promotes a complex decomposition

subsystem that enhances soil system stability and efficiency of nutrient cycling. Basically minimum tillage more closely mimics natural ecosystems than conventional cropping

systems (Francis and Clegg, 1990). Tillage has been reported to reduce the diversity of

bacteria in the soil by reducing both the substrate richness and evenness (Lupwayi et al., 1998). They found that the influence of tillage on microbial diversity in fields planted to wheat was more prominent at the flag-leaf stage of growth than at seeding and more

prominent in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere at the flag-leaf stage.

Kladivko et al., (1986), studied the production of corn and soybean using an array of tillage systems ranging from conventional moldboard plowing and seedbed preparation to no-till

on a range of soils differing in organic matter, texture, and slope for seven-year and six-year periods. At one location on a Chalmers silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls) comparisons of a corn-soybean rotation to continuous crops of these two species using various tillage systems was conducted for 10 years (Table 7). Yields of rotated crops tended to be greater than those of the monocultures regardless of tillage. Kladivko et Concepts in Crop Rotations

41

al. (1986) also reported from this research at other locations that conservation tillage systems resulted in increased soil water contents, lower soil temperatures, increased soil organic matter, and more water-stable aggregates near the soil surface with higher bulk densities than conventional tillage. Corn yields were found to be equal to or better than conventional tillage practices when grown on the better drained soils using conservation tillage. Only on the poorly drained soils did corn yields on conservation tilled fields fail to exceed

conventional tillage, most likely due to low temperatures and excess wetness in the spring as depicted with the Chalmers silty clay in Table 7.

Table 7. Mean corn and soybean yields (Mg ha-1) in response to tillage system and crop

rotation on a Chalmers silty clay loam in Indiana in 1980-1984 (data is from 6th to 10th year of the study). (Kladivko et al., 1986).

Roth (1996) presents several crop rotation schemes to use in no-till farming on Pennsylvania dairy farms. One of the more popular is an alfalfa-grass sward for hay followed by no-till corn. This involves killing the sod in the fall with herbicides to control weeds and reduce residue by early spring to facilitate corn planting. This rotation seems to work best where hay production is limited to three years. Alfalfa is also successfully no-tilled into fields that have just been harvested for corn silage or following the harvest of a spring seeded sorghum sudangrass. Lafond et al., (1992), evaluated no-till, minimum till (one pre-seeding tillage operation) and conventional till (fall and spring pre-seeding tillage operations) on a four-year crop rotation study. The rotations were fallow-spring wheat- spring wheat-winter

wheat, spring wheat-spring wheat-flax ( Linum usitartissimum L.)-winter wheat, and spring wheat-flax-winter wheat- field pea. Tillage systems did not affect the amount of water

conserved during fallow. However, no-till and minimum till did result in an increase in soil water from the surface to 120 cm in depth over conventional till. All three crops in the study had greater yields in the no-till and minimum till treatments than in the conventional till. In an experiment using conservation tillage practices (strip-till or no-till) in combination with a corn-soybean rotation, both full-season soybean or double-crop soybean following wheat

had the most consistent increase in seed yields (Edwards et al., 1987).

In recent years there has been considerable interest in various tillage practices and their influence on the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 as a partial means of mitigating its

current increase and subsequent impact on climate change. Sampson and Scholes (2000),

state that the optimization of crop management to facilitate accumulation of soil organic matter could help sequester atmospheric CO2 and lower the rate of its increase. West and

Post (2002), found that, excluding a change to no-till in wheat-fallow rotations, a change from conventional tillage to no-till can sequester between 43 to 71 g C m-2 yr-1. These

values are within the upper range (10 to 60 g C m2 yr-1) of those reported in a review by Follet (2001). West and Post (2002) also stated that enhanced crop rotation complexity can sequester an average of 8 to 32 g C m-2 yr-1 which is similar to an average of 20 g C m-2 yr-1





42

Agricultural Science

estimated by Lal et al. (1998; 1999) resulting from an improvement in rotation

management.

Conservation tillage can present pest control problems that are different from those found in conventional systems, particularly weeds. Weed species composition and abundance often

change in response to crop and soil management practices (Cardina et al., 2002). Buhler

(1995), wrote that most conservation tillage practices rely heavily on increased herbicide use and that reduced herbicide efficacy has slowed the adoption of conservation tillage

practices. Weed populations have tended to shift more towards perennials, summer annual

grasses, biennials and winter annual species in conservation tillage systems. Moyer et

al.,(1994) stated that successful conservation tillage systems usually involve crop rotations of three or more species and several different herbicides. Legere et al., 1997 concluded that conservation tillage has the potential to produce sustained yields of spring barley in Quebec, provided attention is given to critical aspects such as crop establishment and weed

management. With respect to plant diseases, Peters et al., (2003) determined that soil

agroecosystems can be modified by crop rotation and conservation tillage to increase

disease suppression by enhanced antibiosis abilities of endophytic and root zone bacteria in spring barley and potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.).

10. Conclusions

Crop rotation is very likely to continue to be an important management practice, especially in the developed part of the world. However, economics is always going to have a major

say in the decision making process of what gets planted where and by how much. Our ever

increasing world population is going to place greater pressure on getting more production from our shrinking areas of arable land and potable water needed for drinking, personal

use, and growing crops. Climate change is, despite all of the predictive computer models, a great unknown, not from the standpoint of whether or not it is occurring but as to just what can be realistically done, if anything, to curb it.

Lands that include a fallow period and/or irrigation to produce crops may eventually be

taken out of the food and fiber production equation because of both shifts in the climate and the loss of water for irrigation. Production areas of various crop species may shift due to climate change. Changes in crop genetics through biotech and genetic engineering

may contribute some relief but improvements in water use efficiency are not going to

eliminate the need for irrigation. Also, genetically engineered crops in many areas of the world are not being well received based on fears, real or imaginary, and increased costs of such seed stocks are often prohibitive to many producers. A nearly 500% increase in

energy prices and a shift from food, feed, and fiber crops to renewable energy crops will have an increasing impact on the land available to grow all crops and the rotations to

produce them. Given the history of crop rotations and the overall benefits that appear to be gained from them, it is virtually assured that they will continue to be an important

practice in food production. Despite the difficulties associated with conducting crop

rotation research, it will be beneficial to society as a whole to support efforts in this area and to adequately reward scientists willing to dedicate their professional efforts in such endeavors.

Image Processing for Crop Characterization in a

Context of Precision Agriculture

1. Introduction

The concept of precision agriculture consists to spatially manage crop management practices according to in-field variability. This concept is principally dedicated to variable-rate application of inputs such as nitrogen, seeds and phytosanitary products, allowing for a

better yield management and reduction on the use of pesticides, herbicides … In this general context, the development of ICT techniques has allowed relevant progresses for Leaf Area

Index (LAI) (Richardson et al., 2009), crop density (Saeys et al., 2009), stress (Zygielbaum et al., 2009) … Most of the tools used for Precision Farming utilizes optical and/or imaging sensors and dedicated treatments, in real time or not, and eventually combined to 3D plant growth modeling or disease development (Fournier et al., 2003 ; Robert et al., 2008). To

evaluate yields or to better define the appropriated periods for the spraying or fertilizer input, to detect crop, weeds, diseases …, the remote sensing imaging devices are often used to complete or replace embedded sensors onboard the agricultural machinery (Aparicio et

al., 2000). Even if these tools provide sufficient accurate information, they get some

drawbacks compared to “proxy-detection” optical sensors: resolution, easy-to-use tools,

accessibility, cost, temporality, precision of the measurement … The use of specific image acquisition systems coupled to reliable image processing should allow for a reduction of

working time, a lower work hardness and a reduction of the bias of the measurement

according to the operator, or a better spatial sampling due to the rapidity of the image

acquisition (instead of the use of remote sensing). The early evaluation of yield could allow farmers, for example, to adjust cultivation practices (e.g., last nitrogen (N) input), to organize harvest and storage logistics. The optimization of late N application could lead to significant improvements for the environment, one of the most important concerns that

precision agriculture aims to address.

Agricultural Science

We propose in this chapter to explore the proxy-detection domain by focusing first on the development of robust image acquisition systems, and secondly on the use of image

processing for different applications tied on one hand to wheat crop characterization, such as the detection and counting of wheat ears per m² (in a context of yield prediction) and the weed detection, and on the other hand to the evolution of seed development/germination performance of chicory achenes. Results of the different processing are presented in the last part just before a conclusion.

2. Image acquisition system

Image acquisition is the most important step for robust image processing. Indeed, the use of natural images involves some difficulties tied to outdoor conditions (lighting variations) and object complexity (the leaf area presents several planes, high contrast and lighting

variations, scale variations, wheat growth stages ….). Photographic slides were taken at

different growing stages of the wheatears.

Different solutions exist for image acquisition according to the vertical distance between the camera and the scene (1m, 2m or more), to the illumination used (natural or controlled

light), to the kind of images (color, grey level, hyperspectral ...)

Figure 1 shows one solution based on specific boxes with opaque protection and controlled illumination by power-leds, for wheat ear counting, allowing to obtain color or grey level images.



Fig. 1. Example of image acquisition system (left) and its specific illumination by Led (right) Figure 2 shows some examples of color images of wheat crop at three different growth

stages with controlled illumination.

Fig. 2. Example of image acquisition system (left) and its specific illumination by Led (right) Proxy-Hyperspectral images can also be used and are obtained with specific sensors. As an illustration, images of wheat crop have been acquired in march 2011 on the domain of

Melgueil (INRA, 34-France) by means of dedicated apparatus developed by the Cemagref.

This device is constituted by a motorized rod installed on a tractor which allows a

longitudinal displacement of a push-broom hyperspectral camera located 1 meter above the

vegetation (figure 3).



Fig. 3. Hyperspectral acquisition device

Other imaging system is based on chlorophyll fluorescence. A xenon light source

(Hamamatsu Lightingcure L8222, model LC5, 150 W) is used to produce a white light which

passes through an interference filter (03FIB002, Melles Griot, Carlsbad, USA) with a central wavelength 410 nm and width at half-maximum 80 nm to excite the chlorophyll-a. The light

is conducted to the seeds by an optical fiber. The blue light issued from the filter is absorbed by the seeds chlorophylls, which resulted in fluorescence emission. A high-pass filter (665

nm, 03FCG107, Melles Griot 03FCG107) ensured the selection of the fluorescent signal from the blue light reflected by the object.

The images are acquired by a CCD monochrome camera (Hamamatsu C5405-70), with a

resolution of 640 x 480 pixels and 256 gray levels. The system is enclosed within a black box to avoid interference from ambient light and is air-conditioned (Tectro TS27, PVG Int. B.V., Oss, The Netherlands) to maintain a temperature of 20°C. The lamp is optically isolated and white light did not escape inside the box. The blue filter transmitted an unexpected, small amount of infrared light between 770 and 900 nm (detected with spectrometer AVS-SD2000,

Avantes, Eerbeek, The Netherlands).

3. Proxy-detection image processing for wheat ear counting

Proxy-detection imagery for yield prediction needs the determination of the three components of the yield: number of ears / m², number of grains per ear and the weight per thousand seeds.

Wheat ear shapes are very variable, especially due to the different inclinations of wheatears.

However, wheatears show a very rough surface whereas leaf surfaces are smoother (figure 4).



Leaf surface

Wheatear surface

Considering this specific roughness (figure 4), texture analysis can be used in order to

discriminate wheatears, leaves and ground.

3.1 Texture feature extraction

In order to extract the texture features, a variety of methods have already been proposed in the literature and tested in practice. In this context, three families of texture feature extraction exist: statistical, spectral and structural methods. A successful texture

classification or segmentation requires an efficient feature extraction methodology.

Two methods are discussed in this chapter. The first one is based on statistical analysis by cooccurrence matrices, and the second one is based on Fourier filtering.

3.1.1 Cooccurrence matrices

The principle of these matrices is to count how often pairs of grey levels occur in a digital image of texture. In fact, we take into account pairs of pixels that are located along a given direction defined by the angle  and separated by a fixed distance d.

Let L  1,2,...,



I

NI and L 1,2,...,

J

NJ be respectively the horizontal and vertical spatial

domains and G  0,1,...,  

1 the grey levels.

The digital image f : L 



I

LJ

G assigns a grey level to each pixel.

Furthermore, we consider four directions ( = 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°) along which a pair of pixels can lie. Thereafter, for the distance d, we are able to obtain the unnormalized

frequencies P( ,', ,d) .

For instance, P( ,',0, d) is defined as the cardinality of the set of pixel pairs having the following properties:



For the other angles, the corresponding frequencies are defined similarly. In this document, we consider the distance d = 1 (this means we consider neighboring pixels). Moreover, texture of the wheatears, and, more generally, of the pictures, are not oriented along a

common direction. Thus, for each pair of grey levels we sum over the four frequencies

(corresponding to the four angles) and we note:

Generally cooccurrence matrices are not used directly because of their size. The principle is to compute a set of measures from these matrices, such as those proposed by Haralick

(1973).

Figure 5 shows three samples of ear ,soil and leaf textures: wheatearstexture reveals many transitions between very different grey tones. For leaves and soil the transitions are more progressive.

Thus, we compute four Haralick's features which characterize the particular disposition of the cooccurrence matrix elements for the 3 texture classes:

The four coefficients were calculated for windows of 17x17 pixels surrounding each pixel.

This window size is smaller than the ears' size and allows for reducing noise effects. The computational cost, the cooccurrence matrices were calculated over posterised pictures (32

grey levels), which avoids obtaining hollow matrices, considering the number of pixel in

each window.

Table 1 shows the values of the four features for the 3 samples of the figure 5.

Table 1. Values of the four Haralick's parameters associated with the three textural patterns

The features computed from the cooccurrence matrices are used in a learning step in order to construct a discriminant function, called here textural function, which identifies

efficiently the pixel belonging to the « ears » class.

Considering a trial set of windows, the use of a stepwise selection leads us to selects a subset of parameters (from the four ones describe above) to produce a good discrimination model.

At the first step, we compute the variance ratio F for each feature:

i

n

n ), xi. is the mean of the group i, ..

x is the mean of the trial

set, xik is the value of the window k belonging to the group i.

The value of the variance ratio reflects the parameter’s contribution to the discrimination if it is included in the textural function. The parameter that has the largest ratio is selected at first.

Afterwards, at each step, the order of insertion is computed using the partial F-ratio as a measure of the importance of parameters not yet in the equation. As soon as the partial F-ratio related to the most recently entered parameter becomes non-significant the process is stopped.

In a second stage, a discriminant analysis with the selected parameters is computed. Because there are only two groups to discriminate, only one discriminant factor FD(textural function) is obtained.

3.1.2 Results from the cooccurrence matrices

In order to illustrate the efficiency of this textural function, the values of FD obtained on the image may be rescaled in the form of a gray level scale. For example, figure 6 shows an

original image and the corresponding result after the first stage.

3.1.3 Results and discussion

In order to show its relevance, the Textural function is used in the energy function of a Maximum A Posteriori segmentation algorithm (Martinez de Guerenu et al. 1996). Figure 7

shows separately the Wheatear and Non-wheatear regions resulting from this segmentation

stage. Wheatear region pictures show false positive wheatear detecton (leaves or stems

classified as wheatears). Non-wheatear region pictures show false negative detection

(wheatears that have been forgotten).

Both kind of erroneous classification are circled on the pictures.

Agricultural Science

For the whole set of sample images, 1 to 3 segmentation errors have been found for each

image. As the images show an average of 20 wheatears, the error rate can be estimated around 10%. Most of the errors encountered are identified as badly lightened wheatears. This kind of error could be easily overcome by using artificial light instead of natural light conditions, or using color images instead of grey level images, as it will be shown in the next section.

3.2 Fourier filtering

To improve the previous works, one of the first solution has been to represent each image in a colour-texture hybrid space, and to use mathematical morphology tools (Cointault et al., 2008a) in order to extract and count the number of wheat ears.

Although this previous method gives satisfying results (around 10% of well detection,

compared to manual counting), the hybrid space construction method is a supervised one

and is limited by the objectivity of the operator. Moreover the statistical methods are

dependent on the choice of the direction for the process, need an important computing time and are lightning-dependent.

The objective has been thus to propose new detection algorithms more rapids, robusts, and invariants according to image acquisition conditions, based on Fourier filtering and two

dimensional discrete fast Fourier transform (FFT) (Cooley &Tukey, 1965). This approach includes three important steps: high-pass filtering, thresholding and cleaning of the image based on mathematical morphology operations (Serra, 1982).

3.2.1 The three important steps

For the high pass Fourier filtering, a two dimensional FFT is performed on the target image (eq. 8).

Based on the centered Fourier image, a high pass filter is applied in order to eliminate low frequencies in the FFT image (figure 8). The cut off frequency is empirically sized by a 10

pixels width disk mask as it is shown in the figure 8.

The thresholding of the resulting image is based on anInverse FFT and a predetermined threshold is applied in order to eliminate low pixel values which do not correspond to

wheat objects (ground, leaf,…) (figure Fig. 9).

The cleaning step aims at eliminate remaining “non wheat” pixel groups, which are small and scattered. It lies on mathematical morphology operation and is performed with three sub steps:



First, a dilatation, which aims at making bigger and closer pixel groups in the image.



Then a blurring convolution with a Gaussian smoothing operator, followed by a

thresholding, which eliminate too small groups of pixels. These small groups are

considered as miss. This step makes smaller the pixel groups that correspond to wheat

and then justify a third step.



Finally, another dilatation is performed which aims at regenerate size of pixel groups

corresponding to wheat ears (figure 10).

3.2.2 Wheat ear counting estimation

The first image processing by thresholding and high pass Fourier filtering gives a binary image, composed of several pixel groups. Each group represents one or more wheat ears to

be counted. In order to estimate this number we analyze the shape of each group

considering two possible configurations:



Pixel group presents a convex or nearly convex shape pattern: it is considered that only

one ear is present in this kind of group (figure 11a).



Pixel group presents a concave shape pattern (figure 11b): it is consider that several ears are presents.





(a) (b) (c)

Fig. 11. Pixel groups with nearly convex (a) and concave shapes (b), convex hull of a concave shaped pixel group (c).

In order to quantify the number of wheat ears, we estimate a shape index based on two

features extracted from each pixel group:





c

S

S

Q 

 1 (9)

S

With S the surface and SC the convex hull surface of the pixel group (Figure 6c).

Coming from this index, a number X of ears is attributed for the group, considering this interval:

Another approach, based on skeleton analysis can be found in (Germain et al, 1995).

3.2.3 Results and discussion

A fast visual observation (figure 12) shows that only a small amount of groups corresponds to non-wheat things in image. More precisely, the biggest wheat ears are well detected and well separated from surrounded leaves.

Ears that lie the nearest of the ground, that are partially hidden or that are a little bit over exposed in the image are not well detected. Small amount of very big leaves also remain

after cleaning step.

In order to test our image processing we performed algorithm on 40 images and compare

the results with the mean of manual counting done by several experts. For the example, five images sample have been randomly chosen (table 2).

Within the image set, a high variability of ear’s number can be observed. With most of the images, high pass Fourier filtering method returns slightly higher counts. Based on the

whole image sample, absolute difference between manual counting and image processing

counting is contained under the value of 6%. The mean error obtained is 4,02% for this set of images.

The development of a high pass Fourier filtering approach method aims at creating an

easily usable and adaptable method while obtaining a best wheat ear detection. Therefore, it is essential to compare this approach with previously used methods such as hybrid

space method (Cointault et al., 2008b). For a visual comparison, high pass Fourier filtering has been applied onto images that have been previously treated with hybrid approach

(figure 13).

Fourier Hybrid

Fig. 13. Visual comparison between Fourier and Hybrid approach for two different images.

Visual comparisons with hybrid space results show that high pass Fourier filtering approach eliminate more non wheat objects within the images. Fourier approach separates more

efficiently ear groups. Calculation time for Fourier approach is few sec per image while its few minutes for hybrid space, with the same operating system.

High pass Fourier filtering gives global satisfying results. Although a close range of settings has been determined, inverse FFT remains a parameter that has to be adjusted according to input image. An empirical value has been found and gives good results for most of images

but it could be optimized with an automatic threshold selection such as k-means methods

(MacQueen, 1967).

In the context of wheat detection, it has been observed that some ear objects are eliminated after cleaning step. These non-detections mainly correspond to near ground ears or ears

massively hidden under leaves, hence, it should be relativized as too low ears may have

development problems and may not be considerate within wheat yield. Ears that are located in over or under exposed part of image are not well detected but it is not due to the

algorithm but to the quality of the acquisition, which is limited by the natural conditions.

Small amount of very big leaves also remain after cleaning step and eliminate these artifacts constitute a further axis of development, including shape analysis in cleaning step.

In the context of wheat ear counting, it is observed that counting error percentage decrease with number of ears in images, hence, best results may be obtained with images

representing more area and yet, more ears. Actually, worst error, 5,56%, is obtained with only 36 wheat ears in the image.

It is important to note that in most cases, Fourier approach returns slightly higher counts than manually counts. It should be due to missing detection, such as remaining leaves or

over exposed part of images. Counts should be more precise with the including of shape analysis in cleaning step. In all cases, whatever the method used, the only way to obtain a right detection is to use 3-Dimensional information.

4. Proxy-detection image processing for weed-wheat crop discrimination by

hyperspectral imagery

In the domain of weed control, since the environmental and economical stakes are

particularly great, the herbicides are largely spread in order to assure sufficient yields for the whole field whatever the infestation rate.

The reason is essentially a technological one. Even if some low-cost devices are currently available to assure a localised spraying of herbicides on bare soil (vegetation detection by photoelectric cells), no commercial product allows a reliable and localised post-emergence treatment. Indeed, a such apparatus needs a sophisticated perception system, based on

digital vision and allowing to distinguish between weeds and crops. The identification of varieties inside the vegetation is nowadays the principal lock to the development of

localized weed control.

The corresponding research are numerous and can be divided into two main approaches

(Slaughter et al., 2008):



the spectral approach, in which the plant reflectance is the main parameter, using

hyper- or multispectral images (Feyaerts & Van Gool, 2001; Vrindts, 2002; De

Baerdemaeker et al., 2002). The difficulty is then to propose spectral differences

sufficiently robusts to lightning conditions



the spatial approach, based on spatial criteria such as plant morphology (Chi et al.,

2003; Manh et al., 2001), plant texture (Burks et al., 2000) … The main difficulty is tied here to the complexity and the natural variability of the scenes.

The study proposed in this chapter is tied to the previous approach: hyperspectral images of the wheat crop are acquired during the weed control period, and associated to specific pre-processing to avoid illumination conditions. After, the possible spectral discrimination

between wheat and dicotyledonous weeds by means of chimiometric tools has been evaluated.

4.1 Spectral pre-processing

The images acquired by the camera (after a first internal processing taking into account the spectral sensitivity of the sensor) are images of luminance, which by definition depend on both the reflectance of the scene and lighting conditions. This is why a reference surface (gray ceramic), for which the reflectance Rc was measured in the laboratory, was

systematically placed in each scene (figure 14). The average luminance Lc observed in the image to the reference can then be corrected reflectance for each pixel of vegetation :



Rf = Rc * (Lf/Lc)

(11)

where Lf is the observed luminance for that pixel.

It is important to note that the Rf value obtained is a "apparent" reflectance. Other phenomena are to be considered, namely:



The inclination of the observed leaf from the direction of the solar source, introducing a multiplicative factor of the light, and hence Rf



the possibility of specular reflection, adding a component to the spectrum colorless, and resulting in an additive constant of Rf.





62

Agricultural Science

These two phenomena are taken into account by applying a standard-centering

operation (SNV, or "standard normal variate") on each spectrum of the image (Vigneau et al., 2011).

4.2 Chemometric model

Because hyperspectral images include hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, they have a

very high potential for spectral discrimination, compared to classical colour or multispectral images. Unfortunately, in a classification context, these kinds of high-dimensional datasets are difficult to handle and tend to suffer from the problem of the “curse of dimensionality”, well known as “Hughes phenomenon” (Hughes, 1968) which causes inaccurate

classification (figure 14).



Fig. 14. Illustration of Hughes phenomenon

In this context, it is important to note that some news techniques already exist to

overcome this problem. Among all possible methods, many recent works have focused on

the area of dimensionnality reduction approaches in order to reduce this high-

dimensional datasets while maintaining the relevance of the information contained in the

signal.(Journaux et al., 2008). One of these approaches is the Partial Least Square

Regression (PLS-R) , which builds a low-dimension subspace by determining a set of

spectral “latent variables”. Compared to other reduction methods such as Principal

Component Analysis (PCA), the PLS takes into account both inputs and outputs to build

its subspace, leading to better performances. The PLS-DA (PLS Discriminant Analysis) is

an adaptation of PLS-R to discrimination problems.

In our case, a total of 335 spectra was increased step by step on a first reflectance image (figure 15) in three categories, namely wheat (157 spectra), dicotyledons (60 spectra) and ground (118 spectra).

A PLS-DA model was then determined on this data set by cross-validation using

commercial software in chemometrics (The Unscrambler v9.7, CAMO Software AS, Oslo,

Norway).

The resulting discriminant model, which involves 8 latent variables, was then exported and applied to all pixels in an image test, using a dedicated software developed in C + +.

4.3 Results

Figure 16 shows the image test and the classification results. We observe an excellent

discrimination between wheat and weeds whatever the local conditions of illumination

(shadow), with the exception of one type of weed (red circle) which was not present in the calibration image, and was therefore not included in the model.

pertinent information for agronomic applications.

5. Proxy-detection image processing for seed development and germination

performance of chicory achenes by chlorophyll fluorescence

Several aspects of seed quality are tested routinely to minimize the risk of sowing seedlots that do not have the capacity to produce the desired crop. Amongst these tests, seed

germination is important since it represents the percentage of pure seeds that have the

potential to produce established seedlings in the field. The rate of germination corresponds to the reciprocal of the time needed for a given germination percentage to be reached

(Halmer, 2008). Accurate procedure of germination tests performed in laboratory is defined by the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA).





64

Agricultural Science

Besides these laboratory tests, seed processing lines includes cleaning machines that

remove dust and waste material, and conditioning machines performing dimensional

sizing, density sorting, and colour sorting. In conventional colour sorting, discoloured

seeds are rejected, on basis of inspecting seeds individually to detect differences in

reflected colour.

However, even after several sorting operations, some seed batches can contain a large

proportion of viable seeds but still not sufficient for commercial use. These batches are lost because the viable and non-viable seeds cannot be separated using the conventional

processing methods. The proportion of immature seeds in these lost batches is unknown. It would therefore be useful to provide a new, non-destructive method of distinguishing

immature seeds from mature seeds in order to improve sorting processes.

In this context, the potential of fluorescence imaging (Chen et al., 2002; Nedbal &

Whitmarsh, 2004) has been examined. The chlorophyll degrades during fruit ripening and

the process of degradation was described by Barry (2009). The chlorophyll is also a highly fluorescent molecule. Fluorescence occurs when some of the light absorbed by the

chlorophylls is re-emitted at longer wavelength, typically between 650 and 750 nm. The

fluorescent properties of chlorophylls have been used to evaluate the maturity of cabbage seeds ( Brassica oleracea L.) (Jalink et al., 1998; Jalink et al., 1999). The results showed that the magnitude of the chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) signal was inversely related to the quality of seeds. The relationship between the CF and germination performance was studied for

tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) by Jalink et al. (1999) as in their previous study (Jalink et al., 1998). They concluded that seeds with an intermediate CF level were of the best quality, followed by seeds having a low CF signal. Seeds having a high CF signal were the worst.

Konstantinova et al. (2002) measured the CF of barley grains ( Hordeum vulgare L.) with a SeedScan I Laser Sorter (Satake, Stafford, TX. USA), using the principle developed by Jalink et al. (1998) but including a laser light source instead of a LED. They concluded that sorting a barley seed lot into six subsamples varying in CF values resulted in an optimal quality for the subsamples with low and intermediate CF signals. Suhartanto (2002) thoroughly

described the relationships between the fruit CF, seeds CF and germination performance of tomato.

5.1 Image analysis

A specific image analysis code was developed with the GNU Octave language (Ooms &

Destain, 2011). After applying background correction (the fluorescence values were divided by the reflectance signal of paper and multiplied by 60), the images were segmented and

images of individual seeds were created, each of them being rotated along the main axis of the seed. The pappus side, which is brighter and larger than the radicle tip, was

automatically detected on the basis of the mean width of the left half, its mean fluorescence intensity, the right half width and the right half fluorescence intensity. The accuracy of the detection was greater than 98%. The image was thereafter divided into the “pericarp zone”

(Pe, 77% of the seed length) and the “pappus zone” (Pa, 23% of the length). The value of

77% was a compromise based on the observation of 100 seed images. The mean fluorescence

values of the two zones were recorded for data analysis. The measurement system and

image analysis are summarised in figure 17.

5.2 Results

The observed period corresponds to the phase of reserve deposition in the seed described in Bewley & Black (1994). Figure 18 shows the evolution of CF during this phase on the stalk, the weight parameters (dry weight DW and water content WC) and the germination

performance (GP and GR). The dry weight increased, while the water content was still high at the end of the observed period (> 45 % on the stalk at 44 DAF, while the WC of stored seeds is about 6 %).

confidence intervals of the means.

The two following facts are in favour of the use of CF features for the differentiation of immature chicory seeds from mature ones, and as indicators of seed vigour:



the CF decreased during the filling phase;



the end of the filling phase corresponded to the physiological maturity, where

themaximal germination percentage and vigour is attained (Black et al., 2008).

On the other hand, the efficiency of CF features may be negatively affected by the large

variability of individual measurements (random differences between individuals).

Current work aims at estimating the correlations between the CF features, the weight

parameters and the germination variables in outdoors and greenhouse environments, and to

assess the added value of CF features in comparison to weight, size and density features to distinguish between viable and non-viable seeds using sorting simulations.

6. Conclusion

To predict wheat yield or to determine wheat growth stages, remote sensing is not the

only solution. Proxy-detection systems allow to acquire high resolution images to be

treated by robust algorithms such as high pass Fourier filtering. For example, to predict Texture, Color and Frequential Proxy-Detection

Image Processing for Crop Characterization in a Context of Precision Agriculture

yield, the number of wheat ears has to be determined and is the result of a detection and a counting step. Detection has been done by developing specific image acquisition

system and by implementing algorithms like colour-texture hybrid space or more

classical image processing based on Fourier filtering, according to the frequential

information (redundant information) included in the images. In this chapter, we

presented the high pass Fourier filtering technique which gives satisfying and robust

wheat ear detection with lower computing time. Moreover, we have compared the

detection results with those obtained by representation in a hybrid space. Even if

satisfying results are obtained for this qualitative experiment, some improvements

should be done such as including an automatic threshold determination after the inverse

FFT and an efficient shape analysis in order to obtain a finer wheat ear detection and

better artefacts elimination.

This work has also revealed the possibility of extending the use of pattern recognition

techniques and textural feature analysis to other applications, including the automatic

determination of the wheat growth stage, aiming at creating a decision tool for farmers. At this stage, it seems that we should include an agronomic validation in order to propose

more specific model to help farmers. In the same context one perspective could be to couple proxy-detection with satellite or aerial images. Moreover using multispectral data would

probably improve even more the efficiency of such an approach.

The study of hyperspectral imaging demonstrates the potential to separate weed-culture.

A more comprehensive study must now be conducted to assess the robustness and the

spectral and spatial minimum necessary resolutions in the context of an operational

implementation.

Most fruits and seeds have measurable levels of chlorophyll, respectively in their pericarp or testa, and this chlorophyll degrades with time. In the case of chicory, the commercial seed is a fruit which cannot be hulled and the seed is not observable directly. The low amount of 10

chlorophyll implies the use of a highly sensitive device and because of the presence of a distinct pappus, the imaging of fluorescence is favourable. It would be profitable to identify the factors (variety, season, climate, hydric stress, etc.) influencing the evolution of CF to predict the characteristics of the decrease of CF and to predict if its decrease is always concomitant with the increase of the germination performance.

Finally, combination of several image acquisition systems should give more interesting

results and open the door of the detection of other important crop characteristics.

1. Introduction

Agricultures role on environmental quality has been debated for many decades and

although there has been advances in our understanding of the linkage between

agricultural management and environmental quality, there is still much we don’t

understand about the combination of field-scale and watershed scale management

changes (Hatfield et al., 2009). There is increasing interest in developing solutions to

environmental quality problems originating from agricultural management; however, the

challenge remains on how we integrate the pieces of a very complex puzzle together to

achieve solutions which transcend space and time scale. Within the Midwestern United

States, the reoccurrence of the hypoxic zone within the Gulf of Mexico and the large

increase in the size of the hypoxic zone after the 1993 floods in the Midwest focused

attention on the role of agriculture in nonpoint source pollution. Burkart and James (1999) evaluated the nitrogen (N) balance for the Mississippi River Basin and concluded that

mineralization of soil organic matter and application of commercial fertilizer was two

primary contributors to N load. Jaynes et al. (1999) after examination of a small watershed (5400 ha) in central Iowa found that nitrate-N losses averaged 20 kg ha-1 for this

watershed and reached a level in excess of 40 kg ha-1 during 1993. Hatfield et al. (1998) found that drainage from Walnut Creek was the primary transport pathway for nitrate

and the annual loads were related to precipitation differences among years. Hatfield et al.

(1999) found that for Walnut Creek watershed that drainage through the subsurface drain

lines accounted for approximately half of the annual precipitation with

evapotranspiration accounting for the other half. This movement of water through the soil profile and the solubility of nitrate in water produce large amounts of nitrate-N loss

(Jaynes et al, 1999). These results suggested a strong link between precipitation, crop

water use patterns, and nitrate losses. Occurrence of the hypoxic zone has prompted an

increased level of debate about the need to reduce N inputs into agricultural systems.

Opponents of this conclusion argue that over the past 20 years the input of N fertilizer has not increased, soil organic matter levels haven’t changed, and crop production levels have increased suggesting that the efficiency of the agronomic production system has increased and any change in nitrate loss would be difficult to achieve. Hatfield et al. (2009)

performed an analysis of the temporal changes in the nitrate-N concentrations in the

Raccoon River watershed in central Iowa and observed the changes in nitrate-N

concentrations since the 1970’s were dominated more by changes in land use practices

than on nutrient management. This change in land use affected the soil water balance and

the patterns of water movement within fields and throughout the season rather than

application rates as the primary transport mechanism.

Crop yield response to N has been the focus of agronomic studies and has been primarily

conducted on small plots under relatively controlled conditions. However, the advent of

application systems to differentially apply N across fields has opened up new possibilities for quantifying N response at a scale which producers would have confidence of the

information being applicable to their operations. Understanding field scale responses to N

management practices is critical to the development of precision agriculture tools and

methods for determining the patterns to change application rates within a field. One

method that has been applied to the precision application of N has been to use leaf color or reflectance as a measure of N status. Detection of N stress in crop plants using leaf

color has created opportunities for field-scale evaluation of N response. Some of the

methods that have been employed are the Soil-Plant Analyses Development (SPAD)

chlorophyll meter, color photography, or canopy reflectance factors to assess N variation across corn fields (Schepers et al. 1992, 1996; Blackmer et al. 1993, 1994, 1996a, 1996b; Blackmer and Schepers, 1996). These methods have been based on comparisons of an

adequately-fertilized strip in the same field with a strip with an altered N rate. This

approach eliminates the requirements for prior knowledge of the relationship between

nutrient concentration and crop reflectance.

There have continued to be advances in the use of remote sensing methods to estimate N

status in crops. Lee et al. (2008) used a single waveband at 0.735 μm to quantify N status in rice ( Oryza sativa L.). In their method they used the first derivative of the reflectance at 0.735 μm as difference of the reflectance at 0.74 – 0.73 μm and dividing by ten. They found this to be as accurate as other indices including the normalized difference vegetative

index (NDVI) expressed as (RNIR – RRED)/(RNIR – RRED) where RNIR reflectance in the near-

infrared waveband (0.78 – 0.79 μm) and RRED the reflectance in the 0.61 – 0.68 μm

waveband. They also compared a simple ratio vegetative index expressed as RNIR/RRED.

They used these wavelengths to create maps of canopy N status across fields at the panicle formation stage. They showed the variation in canopy N status but didn’t evaluate the spatial patterns within fields. There continues to be advancements in the use of remote sensing to detect N status in crops, Chen et al. (2010) developed a double-peak canopy N

index to predict plant N concentration in both corn ( Zea mays L.) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and found this worked well for N status; however, did not extend this approach to assess field variation. This is an extension of an earlier method proposed by Haboudane et al. (2002) in which they proposed leaf chlorophyll indices could be used to

predict leaf chlorophyll content for application to precision agriculture. One of the

lingering questions that remain is the degree of variation present in N response across a corn production field.

Spatial variation of crop yield across fields has prompted a series of questions about the role of nutrient management. Jaynes and Colvin (1997) showed that yield variation within

central Iowa fields was related to precipitation differences among years. However, in their study there was not a measure of crop water use within the field with the implied

assumption that precipitation was uniform across the field. Hatfield and Prueger (2001) and Hatfield et al. (2007) found a large amount of spatial variation in water use across fields Spatial Patterns of Water and Nitrogen Response Within Corn Production Fields

75

related to soil types and N management. These results have prompted a series of studies

developed to further elucidate these interactions. Studies conducted on water use and N

application has been done within a single soil type or management zone. There is a lack of information on the interactions among soil, crop water use, and N management that would

help develop an understanding of better N management in cropping systems typical of the

Midwest United States. The increasing concern about the role of agricultural practices on water quality have prompted us to ask a series of questions about the interactions between crop water use, N use, yield, and soils. The objectives of our studies have been to quantify the interactions among N application, crop water use, yield, and soils for central Iowa

production fields on the Clarion-Nicollet-Webster soil association and to determine the

impact of these interactions on N management and potential offsite impacts from drained

agricultural lands.

Spatial analysis of field scale changes have recently been evaluated by Inman et al. (2008).

They determined the relationship between early season NDVI, soil color-based management

zones, and relative corn yields. Values of NDVI were collected at the eight-leaf growth stage and regression models explained between 25 to 82% of the variability in relative yield where relative yield was defined as the ratio of the observed yield to the maximum yield for the field as defined by Brouder et al. (2000). Inman et al. (2008) found coupling NDVI with the color-based soil zones didn’t increase the ability to explain yield within the field. A

complimentary study conducted by Massey et al. (2008) on ten years of site-specific data for corn, soybean ( Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and grain sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor L.) for a 36.5 ha field in central Missouri with claypan soils to quantify temporal changes in crop yield

response. They developed profitability maps for the field and found that large areas of the field had negative profit due to areas of the field in which there was significant topsoil erosion. Brock et al. (2005) showed that high yielding management zones in a corn-soybean rotation were associated with poorly drained level soils while low yielding zones were

associated with eroded or more sloping soils. Sadler et al. (2000a and 2000b) conducted a field scale study on drought stressed corn and found that although there was a relationship between soil map units and grain yield these relationships did not explain the reason for the yield variation. They found that variation among sites within soils was significant and

suggested that improved understanding of yield variation would require more attention to

within season observations of crop water stress. These studies have shown that there is a large amount of variation present within fields and that our understanding of the reasons for these patterns of variation would improve the knowledge base for precision agriculture applications.

There have been several studies that have related remote sensing indices to crop yield and detection of N status in plant leaves; however, there has been little research on the spatial patterns within the field that could lead to improved understanding of the changes that

occur within the growing season. There is a lack of understanding of the interactions

between the spatial patterns of crop water use and N response. This study was conducted to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns of crop water use and couple these observations with observations collected from N strips within fields as part of a N evaluation study. The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial patterns within different fields observed by remote sensing and yield maps collected at harvest with yield monitors to determine the information content contained in spatial analyses of agricultural fields.

2. Methodological approach

2.1 Water-nitrogen interaction studies

Studies have been conducted in the Clarion-Nicollet-Webster Soil Association in central

Iowa within the Walnut Creek watershed. This 5400 ha watershed was described in Hatfield

et al. (1999). Production sized fields have been used as experimental units for these studies because of the need to quantify the effects of different N rates on crop yield and water use across soil types. These production fields ranged in size from 32 to 96 ha each with a similar experimental design. The experimental design was a replicated plot design with strips of

different N rates being a treatment and each treatment replicated at least three times across a field. Nitrogen rates were applied in 1997 and 1998 using a starter application at planting of 50 kg ha-1 only with the second treatment having the N starter rate and the sidedress rate determined by the Late Spring Nitrate Test (LSNT). The third treatment was the starter plus a sidedress rate to represent a non-limiting N rate of an additional 150 kg ha-1. This

experimental procedure was described by Jaynes et al. (2001). In 1999 and 2000, the N

application procedure was modified to further refine N application rates based on the use of the leaf chlorophyll measurements and soil test based on the results obtained from the 1997

and 1998 experiments. The rates applied were 50, 100, and 150 kg ha-1 to different soils, planting rates, and plant population densities (75,000 and 85,000 plants ha-1). Nitrogen rates were applied uniformly across each field using liquid UAN (32% N) for these studies. These applications were applied with production scale equipment to mimic producer operations.

Soil N concentrations were measured prior to spring operations, after planting, and at the end of the growing season after harvest to a soil depth of 1.5 m using a 5 cm core. Cores were subdivided into depth increments to estimate the N availability throughout the root

zone. Sample position was recorded with a GPS unit to ensure accurate location of each

subsequent sample. Nominal plot size for plant measurements and yield determinations

was 15 x 15 m. Yields were measured on 5 m length of row for five subsamples within each

plot in which no plants had been removed or measured during the growing season. Plots

were replicated three times within each treatment.

Crop water use rate was measured from planting to harvest with an energy balance method

(Bowen ratio in 1997 and 1998, and eddy correlation in 1999 and 2000). These units consisted of a net radiometer positioned at 3 m above the canopy, soil heat flux at 10 cm (within the row, middle of the row, and adjacent to the row), wind speed, air temperature, water vapor pressure (positioned at 0.5 and 1.5 m above the canopy), three dimensional sonic

anemometer and krypton hygrometer (positioned at 1 m above the canopy), and an infrared

thermometer (15 fov) positioned at 45 from nadir in a south-facing direction. All

measurements were recorded at 10-second intervals and either 15 minute or 30 minute

averages stored in the data acquisition unit. Data were screened to ensure proper data

quality and then converted to equivalent water depth and summed for the growing season

to determine crop water use. Within each soil-N combination we had a single energy

balance station and this measurement technique provides a sample representative of a 50 m2

area. These instruments were positioned to provide a measurement of the representative

area around the plant measurements. Missing data for a given station were treated by using the relationships among instruments within a soil type across N management practices to

determine the relationships among variables. These relationships were then used to fit in Spatial Patterns of Water and Nitrogen Response Within Corn Production Fields

77

any missing data using an approach similar to the method described by Hernandez-Ramirez

(2010). Generally the length of any missing data was less than 3 hours. The amount of

missing data for these experiments was less than 3% of the total data record.

Crop transpiration rates were estimated from an energy balance model that determined the

soil water evaporation rate based on the leaf area index of the crop and previous

precipitation amounts following the approach described by Ritchie and Burnett (1971). Soil water evaporation rates were estimated from a surface energy balance model based on crop

residue cover amounts and the energy balance. Precipitation for these studies was available from a tipping bucket raingauge located at a meteorological station within 1 km of the field sites.

Crop growth and development were measured in a variety of ways. In 1997 measurements

were made of yield at harvest. Beginning in 1998 and 1999, a more intensive plant regime of weekly plant measurements consisting of leaf area, phenological stage, number of leaves,

dry weight, and plant height were made on 10 plants from each plot and each plot was

replicated three times. In 2000, the frequency was decreased to four destructive plant

samplings to represent the 6-leaf stage, 12-leaf stage, tasseling, and mid-grain fill. Leaf chlorophyll measurements were made on 30 plants in each plot with a leaf chlorophyll

meter at two times per week commencing with the 6 leaf stage and continuing through late

grain fill. The upper leaf was measured at the mid-leaf position until the tassel appeared then the leaf immediately above the ear position was measured. Leaf carbon and N contents were determined on dry, ground samples from same stages as the 2000 plant samples were

collected. For 1999 and 2000 experiments, stalk sugar content was measured with a

refractive method using sap collected from freshly cut stalks. This was done on ten plants from each plot. Grain quality parameters of protein, oil, and starch were measured on

subsamples of grain collected from the hand-harvest samples. Field yields were measured

with yield-monitors mounted on the producers combine. These data were registered with a

GPS unit to obtain field locations.

Data analyses for these studies are based on crop yield, total seasonal water use, and N

application. Water use and N use efficiency was determined by the ratio of crop yield to

either seasonal crop transpiration or N application rates. Intensive plant sampling data are not described in this report but were used to understand the dynamics of plant response to changes in within season N management decisions. Likewise, the leaf chlorophyll and stalk sugar content data were used to guide decisions in the 1999 and 2000 experiments. These

data sets represent a complete analysis of crop-soil-water-N interactions.

2.2 Spatial nitrogen studies

Experiments were conducted in 12 different fields located in central Iowa from 2000 to

2002 (Table 1). These fields varied in size from 15 to 130 ha. Each of the field experiments was similar with strips arranged in the field with different N rates and in three of the

study fields, variable planting rates were also used as a treatment variable. The strips

were a minimum of 50 m wide covering at least 60 rows of corn. The arrangement of the

N treatments was randomized across the field and strips were treated as replicates.

Nitrogen was applied as UAN (Urea and Ammonium Nitrate) as a preplant treatment in

all fields and incorporated into the soil. Rates of N application were determined by using





78

Agricultural Science

soil test records from the producer’s fields to determine the typical rate applied and then using 0.5 and 1.5 times that rate in the other strips. All production practices were

conducted by the producer during the course of the experiment. In one experiment,

planting rates were evaluated and randomly assigned as blocks across the field with N

rates as subplots within a block. Planting rates were also randomized across the field. In each field the same corn hybrid was planted; however, hybrids varied among fields and

years. For each field there were overlays of soil type, elevation collected from Real Time Kinetic GPS equipment to create 1 m contours, and N application rate. Soils within fields were a mixture of Canisteo (Fine-loamy, mixed (calcareous), mesic Typic Haplaquolls),

Clarion (Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls), Nicollett (Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic

Aquic Hapludolls), Okoboji (Fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Cumulic Haplaquolls), and

Webster (Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplaquolls) soils. An example of the field

layout for this experiment is shown in Fig. 1.

Table 1. Nitrogen rates and associated agronomic parameters for the field experiments from 2000 to 2002.

Soil map units were extracted from the soil survey data and detailed topographic data were collected with GPS equipment for each field. Soil nutrient content data were collected from each field for the upper 1 m of the profile for a minimum of 30 locations within each field prior to the growing season. Yield data were obtained from each field using yield monitors on the producers combine and these were calibrated prior to harvest. Yields were corrected to 15.5% grain moisture content.

Remote sensing observations for each field were obtained from an aircraft based

hyperspectral unit with 35 wavebands (Table 2). Details on the wavebands and

radiometric resolution are provided in Table 2 for each waveband. Data were obtained

on clear days at four times during the growing season in May, July, August, and

September. These times were selected to obtain data after planting and before there was

sufficient growth to affect the soil background (May), maximum vegetative growth

(July), mid-grain fill (August), and near physiological maturity (September). The pixel

sizes were nominally 2 x 2 m across the study sites. These data were collected with GPS

signals to provide a location of each pixel and these were georeferenced to the yield data and other parameters collected from each field with a positional accuracy of 5 m. All

data were georeferenced and all data were aggregated into 8 x 8 m pixels for further

analysis. This size was selected because of the width of harvest equipment for the yield

monitor data.

Table 2. Wavebands and bandwidth for the AISA hyperspectral data collected over the field sites in 2000 to 2002.

Data were analyzed on the individual N strips within the field and across the field.

Vegetative indices were computed from the reflectance data obtained from the aircraft data and correlated to strip yield and field level yield observations. Correlation and regression analysis were conducted between N rate and corn yield for each individual field and across all fields for each year of the study. T-tests among means were conducted on differences

between soils within a field strip while analysis of variance was conducted on N rates across a field with an interaction term based on the soil type by N rate comparison. These analyses were made using ANOVA and GLM models in SAS (SAS 2009). Spatial analysis was

conducted for each field using GS+ version 5.1 to determine the spatial relationships among yield and the vegetative indices across different fields. Autocorrelation values were

computed across the field using the field location points as coordinates to compute the

range and sill for yield and the red/green index.

3. Results and discussion

3.1 Spatial variation in soil water use

Results from the studies where crop water use was quantified across the field revealed

major differences among soil types. An example is shown in Fig. 2 for crop water use

patterns for a Clarion and Webster soil with two different N rates. There was only a single meteorological unit in each soil type; however, error analysis for daily measurements are less than 10% of the daily total water use so the differences shown among soil types and N

rates in Fig. 2 are significantly different at the end of the growing season. Crop water use patterns began to deviate shortly after crop establishment and continued throughout the

growing season with the most noticeable difference occurring after Day of Year (DOY) 200

at the beginning of the grain-filling period (Fig. 2). The differences between the Clarion and Webster soil are due to their organic matter content with the Clarion soil having organic matter content between 1-2% and the Webster soil between 4-5%. This leads to a difference Spatial Patterns of Water and Nitrogen Response Within Corn Production Fields

81

in water holding capacity of nearly 100 mm in the upper 1 m for these two soil profiles. By extension, this creates a difference in the amount of soil water available to the growing crop during the season. In this comparison, Clarion soil with the lower amount of N applied

showed the larger amount of crop water use during the season and ultimately showed the

larger grain yield at the end of the growing season compared to high rates of N application.

In typical growing seasons in central Iowa, there is adequate soil water available for plant growth early in the growing season and it is not until the onset of the reproductive period in which crop water use rates increase and precipitation amounts begin to diminish and to

meet atmospheric demand there is a reliance on the amount of water stored within the soil profile.

A recent study by Hatfield et al. (2007) revealed large differences in the daily and

seasonal amounts of crop water use across corn and soybean fields in central Iowa. They

found the primary reasons for these differences were due spatial variation in

precipitation and spatial variation in soils across various fields. These results confirm the observations collected from multiple soils within the same field. The observations

collected from several different studies across multiple years reconfirm the observations shown in Fig. 2.

An extension beyond the crop water use patterns is the development of an assessment of

water use efficiency. Water use efficiency is expressed as the amount of grain yield relative to the seasonal total of transpiration. In this case, transpiration was determined by removing the soil water evaporation component from the total crop water use amounts. In this

analysis, water use efficiency was calculated for the 150 kg ha-1 N application rate. What is 82

striking in this figure is the observation that we have a large number of points which are below the line which can be interpreted as using water but not producing a large yield.

Some of these are related to low N rates; however, others have large amounts of N (Fig. 3).

The primary reason for this type of relationship is due to the seasonal pattern of crop water use (Fig. 2) which causes water deficit conditions in the grain-filling period. Water is the primary variable causing variation in corn yields more than N application rates. These

observations prompted the extension of the N studies to be conducted across a production

fields in central Iowa.

Corn yield response to N applications varied across fields and years (Fig. 4). These data were separated by field and year to remove the potential confounding effects of weather

variation among years. Analysis of the relationship between N rate and yield revealed

that most fields showed no response to N (Table 3). The Sac Field 1 showed a negative

response to N rate while the other fields showed a positive response to N (Table 3). The

different response to N poses a problem in developing a general set of guidelines for N

management and raises questions about why these fields differ in their yield response to

N rate. However, this observation provides an opportunity for application of precision

agricultural tools if the underlying mechanism for the difference can be identified and is consistent among growing seasons to allow for application of this information for

decision-making.

Table 3. Analysis of the effect of nitrogen rates on corn yields from the fields in central Iowa.

There was a range of soils within these fields and across the study sites. Variation among strips within a field for a given N rate was not significant for all fields when evaluated with a simple analysis of variance (ANOVA) using like strips as replicates. Understanding that N

response is not consistent among the different fields creates questions about reasons for N

responses observed among fields. Development of processes for the application of N within a field that takes advantage of information about corn response to N would greatly enhance the efficiency of N use. To explore this question and the lack of a consistent response,

further evaluations were conducted on the data set. An additional data set on N response

across a single field obtained by Hatfield and Prueger (2001) showed that N response was

related to soil water holding capacity (Fig. 5).

Spatial Patterns of Water and Nitrogen Response Within Corn Production Fields

85

All soils showed an increase in yield above the 56 kg ha-1 rate but only the Webster soil showed a positive relationship to increasing N above this rate (Fig. 5). These results show that soils with a higher water holding capacity (Webster) had a different response to N

compared to soils with lower water holding capacity (Clarion, Canisteo). Even though the

studies were conducted at a different location, the soils were similar to those in these N

studies so these results help explain the results shown in Fig. 4. The lack of response to N

across the majority of the fields was related to the distribution of soils within the field. The Sac Field, in 2000, had a decrease in yield with increasing N was caused by the large amount of highly eroded Clarion soils within the field resulting in a limitation on the water holding capacity in the soil profile causing yields to be severely limited by water. These results are similar to those reported by Massey et al. (2008) in which the eroded soils had the lower yields and in this study lower yields were associated with soils having lower water holding capacity. Similar findings were reported by Sadler et al. (2000b) in which they suggested that understanding of site-specific yield maps would be enhanced by observations of water stress within the field. Their observations and those from this study suggest that spatial yield patterns in response to N management are dictated by soil types within the field and the interaction with soil water availability.

In order to understand the spatial patterns of yield within a strip, a stepwise approach was taken to evaluate these patterns. The first step was to evaluate the frequency

distribution of yields for the different N rates as shown for the Coon Rapids field (Fig. 6).

These frequency distributions are similar to other fields in this study. In all fields, the lower N rate had a lower mean yield but a similar range of minimum and maximum

yields compared to the other N rates; however, the distribution showed a wider

dispersion and more variation. As the N rate increased the variation pattern showed

reduced dispersion with a higher frequency of values near the mean value (134 kg ha-1

compared to 200 kg ha-1). In all fields we observed that the higher the N rate the less

variation in frequency distribution with a similar shape of the yield distribution and the range of maximum and minimum values. The distribution of the yields based on the

percentiles showed the 134 and 200 kg ha-1 rates were the same. All three rates showed a

skewed distribution toward the lower yields.

To further evaluate the spatial patterns within fields, yields were summarized by each soil type within each field for N rates. Spatial variation of yields within fields was significant in their relationship to soil variation within the field. Across all of the N rates there was a similar pattern with the higher yields in the Webster soils and the lower yields in the

Clarion soils (Fig. 7). Yields in the Webster soils were larger than the yields in the Clarion soils at all N rates and showed less variation than those in the Clarion soils (Fig. 7). This type of analysis was completed for all of the different fields evaluated in this study and the results shown in Fig. 7 were consistent among all of the fields with the soils having a higher water holding capacity producing the larger yields compared to those soils with lower

water holding capacity.

When the yields are aggregated to create a N response curve across fields, yield differences were significant using a simple T-test between these two soils. These two soils were chosen because they were the most dominant in all of the different fields measured in this study.

Yield differences between the Clarion and Webster soil at the 134 and 190 kg ha-1 rates were over 1000 kg ha-1 and there was a decrease in the corn yield with the N rate of 190 kg ha-1 in 86

the Clarion soil (Fig. 8). This was a similar response as to that observed in the Sac field in 2000 (Fig. 4). The N response curve shown in Fig. 5 suggests that the improved water

holding capacity of the Webster soil allows for enhanced yield compared to the other soils because of the increased available soil water during grain-filling. Seasonal water use

patterns between a Clarion and Webster soil were significant during the reproductive

stage of growth because at this time of the year, crop water use was dependent upon

stored soil water in the soil profile (Fig. 2). These water use patterns lead to differences in crop water stress which affects yield patterns as suggested by Sadler et al. (2000b). This was a consistent finding across all of the fields examined in this study in which the higher water holding capacity soils had a higher yield regardless of N rate. Observations from

N ha-1 rate showed that yields in the Clarion soil were distributed across the range of yields observed in the field. There were changes in the statistical moments for the yields in the different soils within N rates as shown in Table 3. Yields in the 134 and 190 kg N ha-1 rate were not significantly different for any of soils (Table 4). The yield distribution within the soil types reveals the effects of the soil water availability as a major factor in determining yield response to N rates (Fig. 7). Evaluation of the N response across fields will have to account for the water holding capacity of the soil and the precipitation during the growing season in order to interpret the results. Analysis of the yield distributions within fields segregated by soil type demonstrates the impact that available soil water has on

determining the spatial pattern of corn yield.

3.3 Seasonal patterns in fields

Harvested yield represents one point in the season which is the result of all of the interacting factors during the season. One question is whether the factors that affect yield patterns at harvest persist throughout the growing season or are there changes which occur and are

detectable only in grain yield. Application of techniques related to improved management

decisions require that observations within a field be able to detect a plant response that is ultimately related to crop yield as part of the decision making process. Sadler et al. (2000b) suggested that yield patterns could be explained by following the patterns of crop stress during the season. These data sets contain a sequence of measurements during the growing

season that may be related to crop yield. The hyperspectral remote sensing data allowed for several indices to be calculated; however, one of the relationships we examined was the red (0.681µm) /green (0.561µm) ratio. This ratio was selected because of the strong relationship to crop biomass and crop yield. There was an inverse relationship between yield and the

August red/green index for the fields (Fig. 9). Although there was a large variation about the regression line, this index showed a significant relationship with yield compared to

other vegetative indices. Seasonal patterns of different vegetative indices provide insights into the spatial patterns of vegetative response during the course of the growing season. In this study we evaluated the NIR (0.819 µm) /red (0.681 µm) ratio and found that this

vegetative index was not consistently related to yield across all of the fields while the red/green relationship showed a more consistent relationship across all of the fields. There are large varieties of vegetative indices that can be computed from the wavebands shown in Table 2; however, the consistency of this index across the fields in this study was one of the primary reasons for its use in these analyses. Hatfield et al. (2008) reviewed the different indices derived from remote sensing signals and their relationship to various agronomic

variables and there are a variety of different indices which can be applied to these fields and in this study the red/green index provided a useful method of assessing response across

fields.

Red/Green Ratio



Fig. 9. Relationship between corn yield and red/green ratio observed in August with an

aircraft scanner for the Dallas South field in 2002.

A more detailed examination of the red/green ratio was conducted with the observations

collected four times during the growing season. Observations throughout the season represent unique characteristics of the growing season, May observations represent the soil background, July represents maximum vegetative cover, August the point of mid-grain fill, and September the time near physiological maturity (Fig. 10). At each of these times the frequency distribution of the red/green ratio was computed for each N rate within the field. There is a seasonal trend in the frequency distributions with a decrease in the variation found in the distribution from the May to July or August observations and then an increase in variation for the September observations (Fig. 10). Variation in the red/green ratios early in the season was related to the soil variation within each N rate. The variation in the July and August observations was small for all three N rates. Observations of the water use patterns among soils within a field showed little difference at this time of the growing season because there was adequate soil water in all soils to meet crop demands. Later in the growing season the crop water demand exceeds the precipitation and crop water use is dependent upon stored soil water and variation among

soils becomes evident and the variation in the red/green ratio is similar to the bare soil distribution (Fig. 10). There was no significant difference among the 67, 134, or 200 kg N ha-1

rates for the frequency distributions of the red/green ratio (Fig. 10). The frequency patterns of the red/green ratios within N rates follow the yield patterns. Spatial patterns of reflectance reveal the seasonal dynamics of the interactions of soil types with N rates. These same patterns of red/green reflectance throughout the season were the same across all of the fields within this study. There is a consistent pattern in terms of a decreasing variation as the crop develops until mid-grain fill and then variation increases during the later grain-fill stages. The only difference among fields was whether the early grain-fill observations began to reveal spatial variation because of the lack of soil water in the profile and limited precipitation to meet the crop water demands. In fields with adequate soil water during grain-fill the variation is less pronounced.

Agricultural Science

Spatial analysis of the red/green index for the May and August periods during the 2002

growing season showed the effect of the soil differences for the May image with the

differences from west to east that were related to the distribution of soil types within the field (Fig. 11). The presence of waterway was very evident in this kriged map of the field.

The range of the samples was 20 m indicating there were detectable differences over

relatively short distances within the field. In other fields the range was considerably

longer and on the order of 80 to 100m. Spatial analysis was able to reveal the patterns of the soil types within the fields. This is in contrast with August image in which there is little variation across the field in the red/green ratio (Fig. 12). There is one spot with poor plant growth that was detectable in the field. In this analysis there was no stable

range in the data because there were no significant spatial patterns detected within the

field. These interpolated maps confirm the analysis conducted within each strip that

showed the July and August periods have the least variation in vegetative indices across

the field because the crop growth is uniform (Fig. 12). The growth of the crop reduces the variation within the field and there is no detectable variation caused by the N rates

within this field. Spatial analysis of the September red/green ratios showed the variation had reoccurred within the field (Fig. 13). This temporal pattern was common across all of the fields in which the variation in the red/green ratio decreased in the July and August observations and there was no correlation of these ratios with soil types within the field.

The reason for this pattern is that during this phase of crop growth the water use rate is small and with the soil profile completely recharged at the beginning of the growing

season there is more than sufficient soil water along with the precipitation to produce a uniform growth across the field. During the grain-fill period when crop water use rates

are larger and precipitation is more infrequent then soil water availability from the soil profile becomes a critical factor and influences the red/green ratio because of the effect on leaf senescence.

Fig. 13. Spatial map of the red/green ratio for the Coon Rapids field in 2002 for the

September image.

Spatial variation maps for the Coon Rapids field in 2002 showed the yield variation patterns that indicated evidence of a relationship to N rates at the higher N rate of 200 kg ha-1. The May spatial analysis image had a significant correlation with the yield of 0.65. These strips had higher yields in parts of the field but were not consistent across the entire strip and there was a difference between the west and east end of the field (Fig. 14). The September red/green patterns were significantly correlated with the May red/green values with a

value of 0.70 and are indicative of the role of soil variation and the effect on soil water dominating the effect of N. The higher yields were found in the Webster soils as shown

earlier with the frequency distribution of yields. The spatial map of yields show these high yields but the high yields are not consistent with N rates. There was the reemergence of the presence of the waterway within the field in the yield map that was present in the May

spatial map of the field. These patterns within fields were found in the other fields we

examined in this study and there was a significant correlation between the yield and soil type across all fields of 0.58. The growing season conditions during these study years had normal or slightly below normal precipitation amounts during the growing season and

above normal precipitation during grain fill would offset these relationships and allow for more potential benefit of applied N. This finding confirms the observations from Jaynes and Colvin (1997) in which the spatial variation of yield was related to seasonal precipitation and extends their results to include the interacting effects of N management.

4. Conclusions

Nitrogen response across agricultural fields is more complex than observing a consistent

response across a change in management practices. Observations among fields has shown

that when multiple soils are encountered within a production field there are spatial patterns in both water use and N impacts on crop yield. There have been few studies which have

coupled water and N dynamics across corn production fields. It has been assumed that

water patterns operate separately from N management practices; however, the spatial

patterns within a field show there is a temporal and spatial pattern determined by the

combination of the precipitation patterns during the season, the soil water holding capacity, and the crop growth (crop water use) patterns. Observations of N impacts on corn yield

across production scale fields revealed that yield responses were dependent upon the soil type and within a rate strip there were a range of yields and when further dissected into the Spatial Patterns of Water and Nitrogen Response Within Corn Production Fields

95

spatial patterns, these spatial patterns were related to the water use patterns and soil water holding capacity. The observations from this study revealed that N impacts on crop yield

were directly related to soil water holding capacity and to improve N response an

improvement in soil water availability during grain-filling would be necessary.

Observations of the changes in the spatial patterns during the growing season have shown

that there is complex interaction between the patterns of soil within the field and the final pattern of corn yield as a function of the patterns of soil water use and N management inputs.

Agriculture will benefit from an enhanced understanding of the interactions of soil water use and N management and how these interact across a production field. The combination of

remote sensing along with yield maps offers an enhanced method to evaluate field scale

responses to both weather and management which will benefit production efficiency. These

efforts will lead toward improved production efficiency and enhance the capability of

agricultural systems to become more efficient in terms of water and N use.

Long-Term Mineral Fertilization and

Soil Fertility

1. Introduction

Long-term experiments are very important in studying the changes of soil fertility and

environmental conditions as well as in analyzing the stability and quality of crop

production. Such experiments give us more information how to use the good agronomic

practices and how to protect the nature. Probably the oldest still-running arable crop

fertilizer experiment is the Broadbalk Experiment established by John B. Lawes in

Rothamsted (UK) in 1843 (Goulding et al., 2000). Thanks to this experiment many other

long-term fertilizer experiments were established worldwide (Sims, 2006; Khan et al., 2007; Takahashi&Anwar, 2007; Kunzova&Hejcman, 2009).

In Bulgaria also have investigations on such long-term fertilizer trails (Koteva, 2010;

Panayotova, 2005; Nankova et al., 1994 & 2005; Nankova, 2010).

Dobrudzha Agricultural Institute-General Toshevo is situated in North-Eastern part of

Bulgaria on black earth zone (Picture 1). The main soil type is chernozem (Haplic

Chernozems WRBSS, 2006).

The aim of this investigation was to follow the effect of the long-term agronomy practices and especially fertilization on the nutrition regime of slightly leached chernozem soil in the region of South Dobrudzha after 40 years mineral fertilization with different norm and

combination between nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.

A long-term fertilizer experiment , which was established in 1967 is still running. In two field crop rotation (wheat-maize) four nitrogen and phosphorus and three potassium

norms were tested – 0, 60, 120, 180 and 0, 60, 120 kg/ha respectively. The experiment was designed according to the method of the “net square”, applying the full version of the

design in four replications. The experiment was designed by the method of the “net

square”, applying the full version of the design (4 x 4 x 3 = 48) in four replications. On the 40th year from the beginning of the trial (2007) after wheat harvest, soil samples were

taken every 20 cm down the soil profile till depth 400 cm. A motor-driven portable soil

sampler was used (Iliev&Nankova, 1994; Iliev, 2000). The changes of some agrochemical characteristics were determined in selected variants with high average 40th year

productivity.

The soil acidity forms were determined by Ganev&Arsova (1980).

The potential nitrogen-supplying ability of soil was determined through incubation under

constant temperature of 30o C at 60 % humidity from its total moisture absorption capacity in order to develop optimal conditions for nitrification. Incubation was done in thermostate to investigate its dynamics at the 14th, 28th and 56th day. The samples were analyzed to

determine the amount of nitrate nitrogen in 1 % K2SO4 extract. The ability of NO3-N to form intensive yellow coloration when interacting with disulphurphenoloc acid

[C6H3OH(HSO3)2] in alkali media was used.

Carbon contend was valuated using the Tyurin modification (oxidizing with

K2Cr2O7/H2SO4 solution in thermostate at 1250С, 45 min, at presence of Ag2SO4 and titration with (NH4)2SO4.FeSO4.6 H2O (Kononova&Belchikova,1961; Spiege at al, 2007; Hegymegi at al, 2007). Composition of soil organic matter was determined by Konnova (1963) and

Filcheva&Tsadilas (2002).

Data were analysed with Excel and SPSS 16.0 (2007) and means separated by the Waller-

Duncan test (P<0,05).

2. Influence of long-term mineral fertilization on some agrochemical

characteristics of slightly leached chernozems (Haplic Chernozems)

One of the main degenerative processes in soil is the so called acidification. Various acid complexes are formed in soil as a result from soil formation processes on the one hand

(erosion, humification, leaching, podzolization), and on the other – as a result from the activity of micro organisms and plants. Soils also possess buffer systems to counteract the acidification, which differ by their capacity.

2.1 Changes in soil acidity forms

2.1.1 Soil acidity forms for the 0-400 cm profile

The soil acidity forms, averaged for the investigated depth of the 0-400 cm profile, were significantly affected by the type of fertilizer combination. The independent effect of the factor mineral fertilization was higher on exchangeable Al3+, Ca2+ and the sum of Са2+ and Mg2+, and significantly lower - on the values of residual hydrolytic acidity and the rate of alkali saturation. The depth of the investigated profile was the factor with decisive effect on all forms of soil acidity. Its effect on the pH values, the residual hydrolytic acidity and the alkali saturation degree was over 90 %. Significantly lower was its influence on the

exchangeable Al3+ (22.5%) and the sum of exchangeable Са and Mg (45.8%).

In spite of the maximum degree of significance of the effect of mineral fertilization on the forms of soil acidity, the amplitude of variation of the separate indices was not so well expressed as in the separate soil layers up to 400 cm down the soil profile. Averaged for the fertilization variants, pH varied from 6.35 (10-20 cm) to 8.53 (260 – 300 cm). Soil reaction increased down the soil profile and at the 4th meter there was well expressed correlation between the soil layers forming it. It, however, showed similarities to layers 160-180, 180-200

and 200-220 cm. The layers from 220 to 300 cm possessed higher pH values in comparison to the layers of the 4th meter.

The amount of exchangeable Ca2+ showed a gradual tendency toward decreasing down the

depth profile. Amplitude of variation was from 28.49 cmolckg-1 (60-80 cm) to 18.79 cmolckg-1

(380-400 cm). The surface layers 0-10 and 10-20 cm had lower content of exchangeable Ca2+ in comparison to the layers under them up to depth of 100 cm, being more similar to the amounts found in the 2nd meter. Highest amounts were detected in layers 60-80 cm and 80-100 cm.

The amount of exchangeable Mg2+ had a clear tendency toward increasing down the soil

profile, being highest in the 340-360 cm layer (8.10 cmolckg-1). In the trial field, layers 80-100, 120-140 and 60-80 cm had lowest content of exchangeable Mg2+ – about 1-2 cmolckg-1. The

surface layers within the 1st meter were comparatively richer in it, but their content

considerably conceded to the content in the deeper layers of the 3rd and 4th meter.

The sum of the two exchangeable cations down the profile varied from 25.38 cmolckg-1 (120-140 cm) to 30.51 cmolckg-1 (60-80 cm). The surface layers (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) had lower sorption capacity, ∑Ca+Mg and degree of saturation with bases than the 0-20 cm layer

according to the trial beginnig. According to Nankova (2005, Personal Communication) at

the start of this long-term experiment the values of these parameters were 34,44 cmolckg-1 , 30,80 cmolckg-1 and 91,2% respectively. Further down the profile the sorption capacity

decreased. What is very impressive is that it significantly increased in the 4th meter

regardless of the occurrence of Ha in the 360-380 and 380-400 cm layers. The main reason for this is the higher amount of exchangeable Mg2+ in the 4th meter, which makes it very

distinctive from the layers above it.

The degree of saturation with bases was lowest in the surface layers 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm due to the intensive anthropogenic activity on the one hand, and on the other – due to the presence of plants. From the 40-60 cm layer the values of this index increased. In the entire 2nd meter the degree of saturation with bases was more than 99 %, and in the third meter it was 100 %. This value remained the same in the upper part of the 4th meter but in the layers 360-380

and 380-400 cm decreased slightly and was closer to the values registered in the 2nd meter. The reason for this is the occurrence of residual hydrolytic acid in the lower part of the 4th meter.

The separate meters up to depth 400 cm, as well as the sub-layers (horizons) at each meter (every 20 cm) affected to a maximum degree of significance the investigated indices

characterizing the soil acidity forms in the investigated fertilization variants. The

comparison of the results for the indices characterizing soil acidity revealed clear

differentiation by each meter down the investigated soil profile.

Table 2. Sorption capacity (T8.2), exchangeable cations and degree of saturation with bases by meter down the soil profile

Averaged for the investigated fertilization variants, the 1st meter had lowest pH values, exchangeable Mg2+ and degree of saturation with bases. This meter, at the end of the 40-year period of investigation, showed harmful exchangeable acidity untypical for the natural

status of this soil type. The first meter was also characterized by significantly higher content of residual hydrolytic acidity and higher sorption capacity in comparison to the other

depths down the profile. In the 2nd and 3rd meter, with the exception of pH and the degree of saturation with bases, all other indices decreased their values. The third meter was

characterized with complete absence of residual hydrolytic acidity, 100 % saturation with bases and increased content of exchangeable Mg2+ - with 73.9 % more above the 1st meter

and with 71.2 % more above what has been established in the 2nd meter. What was typical

for the separate layers of the 4th meter, besides the visually distinct coloration of these layers, was once again the occurrence of residual hydrolytic acidity, comparatively high increase of the content of exchangeable Mg2+ in comparison to the 3rd meter (62.6 %). Averaged for this depth, a higher sum of exchangeable bases was determined in the trial field in comparison to the 2nd and the 3rd meter, as well as higher sorption capacity of soil.

In spite of the average data for 400 cm, 40 years mineral fertilization caused a big difference on the forms of soil acidity accorfing to kind of fertilizer variant. The differentiation between variants of fertilization is very well expressed (Table 3). Soil reaction varied in narrow limits, but in spite of this it was established decreasing of pH in variants N180P60K60 и N60P180K0

according to the control variant. By the Waller-Duncan test there were established a very well expressed differences in all soil acidity forms, as well as in degree of saturation.

The lowest values of residual hydrolytic acidity (H8,2) were registered in the variant with independent fertilization with 180 kg P2O5/ha (0.87 cmolckg-1 soil). Residual hydrolytic acidity is one of the forms strongly affected by the long-term mineral fertilization, especially in the variant with N180P60K60 (1.36 cmolckg-1 soil). High amplitude of variation was determined for residual hydrolytic acidity down the soil profile: from its complete lack to 5.90 cmolckg-1 soil.

As was shown the highest values were established in the surface layers, 0-10 and 10-20 cm, which are most influenced by the agronomy practices fertilization and tillage.

The strongest evidence for the high effect of the long-term mineral fertilization with various norms and ratios on the agrochemical condition of the slightly leached chernozem soil in the trial field was the occurrence of exchangeable Al3+ in the soil absorption complex. It was detected in the surface layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm) in the variants N180P0K0 and N180P60K60. It was not present in the soil absorption complex further down the profile.

Table 3. Sorption capacity (T8.2), exchangeable cations and degree of saturation with bases according to variants of fertilization, average for 0-400 cm depth

The variant with independent nitrogen fertilization with 180 kg/ha has the lowest ∑ Са+Mg and the lowest value of sorption capacity. Intensive mineral fertilization with N180P60K60

caused decreasing of degree of saturation with bases.

2.1.2 Compare the changes of soil acidity forms after 30th and 40th years mineral

fertilization

For the first time in Bulgaria in such long-term trial we compared the obtained results for the individual indices which characterize the forms of soil acidity for the end of the 30th and the end of the 40th year since the initiation of the experiment in some of the variants to 60 cm depth.

At the end of the 40th year, the tendency towards lower values of pH and sorption capacity of soil became more prominent to various degrees according to the type of fertilization

variant . This tendency was most evident in the variant with N120P120K120, where a decrease with 17.2 % according to the end of the 30th year was determined.

A serious change was observed also towards decrease of the values of acidity on the

strongly acid positions (TCA) of the soil adsorbent with the increase of the duration of

mineral fertilization in the above variants, and respective significant increase of this acidity, but this time on the slightly acid positions of the soil adsorbent. The indicated change led also to decrease of the rate of alkali saturation. The decrease varied from 4.4% (N120P0K0) to 8.1% (N120P120K120).

Furthermore, during the last decade the balanced treatment with NPK at norm 120 kg/ha

was the variant with lower values of Т8,2 and ТСА, while at the end of the 30th year of this trial the values of the above indices were higher than the values of the check variant and the values of the variants with independent nitrogen fertilization with increasing norms. The negative changes in the absolute values of these indices occurred also when determining the percent of acidity on the highly acid positions of the soil adsorbent (Fig. 2).

The changes caused by the long-term agricultural usage of the land concerned also

changeable Ca and Mg and their respective sum (Table 5). During the last investigated

period changeable Са2+ decreased in all tested variants, most strongly in the variants treated annually with N120P120K120. The check variant (N0P0K0), as well the variants with

independent nitrogen fertilization, were less affected by this process. The amount of

exchangeable Са2+ at the end of the 40th year averaged for the investigated variants was 88.76 % from the amount at the end of the 30th year. A tendency was found towards lower

amounts of exchangeable Mg2+ in the check variant and the variants with independent

nitrogen fertilization, and towards significant increase in the variant with systematic

balanced introduction of the main macro elements (N120P120K120). At the end of the 30th year the investigated variants were characterized with a mean content of exchangeable Mg2+ of

3.66 cmolckg-1 soil, and at the end of the 40th year – of 3,05 cmolckg-1 soil. The comparison of the results for ∑ Са+Mg revealed their decrease with averagely 12 % according to the data from the end of the 30th year, the decrease being greatest in the variant N120P120K120.

Agricultural Science

At the end of the 40th year the acidity on the highly acid positions averaged for depth 0-60

cm was 23.77 cmolckg-1 soil, compared to 32.58 cmolckg-1 soil at the end of the 30th year, i.e.

there was a decrease with 27.04 % (Table 5). pH variations affected most strongly the 20-40

cm layer. The established negative tendencies affected the 40-60 cm layer as well, where a significant decrease of the sorption capacity of soil was determined: with 9.6 % according to the values at the end of the 30th year.

At the same time the acidity on the slightly acid positions strongly increased in all three layers, the mean increase being almost three times higher, and affected mostly the 40-60 cm layer. These results also concern the rate of alkali saturation, which, too, demonstrated a tendency towards decrease. The decrease was highest in the surface 0-20 cm layer (8.1 %), in the 20-40 cm layer (6.5 %) and in the 40-60 cm layer (4.1 %).

The changes which occurred down the investigated profile confirmed the established

tendencies towards change in the values of the exchangeable cations during the respective periods of investigation depending on fertilization. The increase of the values of residual hydrolytic acidity affected most the surface 0-20 cm layer (Table 6). This layer was

characterized with highest decrease of the changeable Са2+ values, the amount of

exchangeable Mg2+ remaining practically the same. Within both periods of analysis the sum of exchangeable alkali increased down the profile due to the exchangeable Са2+.

2.2 Changes of the soil mineralization ability after 40-years mineral fertilization

Transportation, redistribution and transformation of nitrogen down the soil profile was

affected by a number of factors such as the structure of soil units, aeration, macro pores, composition, amount and depth of post harvest residue incorporation, mineral fertilization and nitrogen norm, mineralization of organic substance, leaching, productive moisture, etc (Goldbi et al., 1995; Karlen et al., 1998). The size of the nitrogen norm is significant for agricultural production under moist, semi-dry and dry conditions to obtain acceptable





Long-Term Mineral Fertilization and Soil Fertility

balance between economic and non-economic part of the produce and avoid possible losses

(Cantero-Martinez et al.,1995). It is well known that the availability of the nitrogen from the mineral fertilizers depends strongly on the type of the nitrogen source, the soil type, the crop, the fertilization norm, etc. Many farmers tend to apply higher nitrogen norms to

ensure higher yields (Franzluebbers et al., 1999). This in many cases is not necessary due to changes in the distribution of the nitrogen in the surface of the soil profile and its improved mobility (Rice et al., 1986).

The ability of soil to nitrify nitrogen under optimal conditions was significantly affected by the mineral fertilization and the investigated layer up to depth 400 cm (Table 7). During all three investigated periods of increasing incubation, this effect was significant to a maximum degree both under the independent influence of the investigated factors and under their interaction.

Table 8. Variance analysis of the mineralization ability during a 40-year period of

investigation

The depth of the soil layer was the factor with higher effect on the values of the soil’s mineralization ability in comparison to mineral fertilization during all three incubation periods (Figure 1). The longer the period of incubation was, the higher its effect, reaching a maximum at 28-day incubation. Regardless of a slight decrease in the effect of this factor at 56-day incubation, the longer incubation had higher effect on the obtained results in

comparison to 14-day incubation. The effect of mineral fertilization was lowest in the second incubation period and slightly increased in the third incubation period. The long-term

mineral fertilization affected the amount of the established NO3-N to a highest degree at 14-day incubation. The same was valid for the interaction between the two factors.

The distribution of the amount of nitrified nitrogen averaged for the periods of

incubation by meters down the soil profile showed interesting results (Table 8). The soil layers of the 1st meter had highest potential nitrogen-supplying capacity. The layers

forming the 2nd and the 3rd meter (loess horizon) had lowest nitrification capacity

regardless of the favorable conditions for this process. The Waller-Duncan test did not

reveal differences between them. It, however, differentiated the results obtained for the content of NO3-N averaged for the 4th meter in a separate group after what was

established in the 1st meter.

Table 10. Mean content of NO3-N according to the type of fertilization variant (mg NO3-

N/1000 g soil)

The check variant (N0P0K0) reflected the natural fertility of Haplic Chernozems in the trial field after its long-term cultivation. The check variant had lowest content of NO3-N after incubation among all tested variants. The fertilization variants were well differentiated on the basis of the total amount of NO3-N after incubation. The independent nitrogen

fertilization with increasing norms was accompanied with proportional increase of the

amount of nitrified nitrogen, the values of which fell within separate groups of higher

orders, compared one to another.

When combining nitrogen with phosphorus and potassium depending on the norms and

ratios between the three elements, the 4-m soil layer had variable capacity to supply nitrates as a result from incubation. Highest amounts of this inorganic nitrogen form were found

after systematic application of N180P60K60 – 21.63 mg NO3-N/1000 g soil. The systematic



Long-Term Mineral Fertilization and Soil Fertility

107

application of N120P120K120 for a period of 40 years showed lowest amounts of nitrified

nitrogen following the check variant. Averaged for the 4-m soil profile, they were lower

than the amounts after independent application of the same nitrogen norm. The main reason for this was that after this type of fertilization the highest yields from wheat were obtained, averaged for the 40-year period of investigation, which, on its part, was an indication for their uptake and respective realization into cash crop. The results with regard to the

nitrification capacity from the analysis of this fertilization variant revealed considerable similarities to that of the check variant. The comparatively low amounts of nitrified nitrogen after systematic fertilization with N120P120K120, combined with high agronomy effect, showed that this fertilization combination can not lead to accumulation of inorganic nitrogen in soil (in nitrate form) down the soil profile.

The incubation periods of soil under conditions favorable for the nitrification process also significantly affected the values of nitrified nitrogen (Table 10). With the longer incubation periods, the mean total amount of nitrified nitrogen increased with increasing the days of incubation. This lead to clear differentiation of the incubation periods and to formation of the results into separate groups.

Table 11. Mean content of NO3-N according to the incubation period (mg NO3-N/1000 g soil) 2.3 Changes of the soil organic matter after long-term mineral fertilization

2.3.1 Carbon concentration along the soil profile to 400 cm depth

Systematic mineral fertilization carried out for 40 years in two-field crop rotation (wheat –

maize) affected the content of Ctotal deep down the profile of the slightly leached

chernozem soil. Annual fertilization with N180P60K60 during 40 years contributed most

for the increase of its content at average depth 0-400 cm. Independent nitrogen

fertilization with increasing norms, especially with 120 and 180 kg N/ha, had low effect

on the content of Ctotal, averaged for depth 0-400 m (Fig 4). This type of fertilization

contributed less to the total carbon reserves in soil, averaged for the 60 cm layer. The

fertilization variants involving phosphorus and phosphorus plus potassium in the norms

and ratios investigated in this study had more significant effect on the increase of these reserves; in this case there was an average increase with 18.7 % in comparison to the check variant without fertilization.

Along the soil profile, the sub-depths forming the 3rd meter had lowest Ctotal

(respectively humus). No differentiation affected by the fertilization variant was found

in this zone. The layers comprising the 4th meter had higher Ctotal content in

comparison to the 3rd meter, and the differentiation in its content depended on the

applied fertilization variant.

2.3.2 Soil organic mater composition along the soil profile to 400 cm depth

The variance analysis of the composition of the soil organic substance down the layers of the soil profile up to depth 400 cm revealed the dynamics in the degree of significance of the changes of C in the respective groups and fractions as a result from the long-term mineral fertilization. Although the indices of variations of the respective fertilization variants were not significant, the established differences between the investigated fertilization

combinations were significant to a maximum degree, averaged for depth 0-400 cm.

Organic C of soil was also subjected to dynamic changes averaged for the entire 4 m depth.

In this index the differentiation between the variants was less expressed in comparison to total C. Its amount was lowest in the untreated check variant.

Highest differentiation in the content of organic C according to the type of the fertilization variant was established in layers 40-60 cm and 60-80 cm, and lowest variation was found in the 260- 280 cm layer.

The independent nitrogen fertilization with 180 kg N/ha contributed most significantly to the increased amount of Corganic averaged for a considerable depth down the profile. In this case, however, Сhumin had lowest values. A similar tendency was found in the independent

nitrogen fertilization with 120 kg N/ha, as well. In these two variants the amount of Сhumin, also called “guard of humus”, was below the level of the check variant. The independent

nitrogen fertilization with 60 kg N/ha, the independent phosphorus fertilization with 180 kg P2O5/ha, the combination between them and the systematic balanced introduction of NPK

at norm 120 kg/ha did not in practice affect the insoluble fraction of organic substance of soil under systematic agricultural cultivation of the land. Not only in the respective layers, but also in the entire 0-400 cm depth, the long-term independent nitrogen fertilization with 120 and 180 kg/ha lead to lower amounts of the insoluble residue. This is valid to a higher degree for the norm 180 kg/ha. Lowest differentiation in the values of Cresidue between the fertilization variants was determined in the 320-340 cm layer. Highest variations between the fertilization variants were established in the 0-20 cm, 60-80 cm and 380-400 cm layers.

The systematic introduction of N180P60K60 had most significant contribution for Cresidue

increase average for 0-400 cm profile.

Table 14. Content of Cresidue by layers up to 400 cm according to the fertilization variants The percent of Corganic in comparison to Ctotal of soil varied within a wide range: from 43.11 %

in the variant with N180P60K60 to 71.51% in N18P0K0. With the exception of systematic

introduction of N180P60K60, all other fertilization variants involved in the study contributed to the higher percent of the total humus substances in Ctotal of soil. The results from the investigation on the changes of organic C of soil showed that the independent nitrogen

fertilization, especially with annually applied high norms, had a strong negative effect on the mobility of the organic substance and caused serious decrease of the percent of carbon in the insoluble residue.

The carbon of humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA) also varied considerably depending on

the mineral fertilization (Fig.5). Regardless of the lower values of C of HA and FA down the soil profile, the variations between the fertilization variants were significant to a maximum degree, averaged for 0-400 cm depth. They were not significant for C-HA in the 0-40 cm

layer and for C-FA in the 200-220 cm and 240-260 cm layers. Highest differentiation in the values of C-Ha between the fertilization variants was found in the 80-100 cm and 360-380 cm layers, and of the values of C-FA – in the 360-380 cm layer. Averaged for the investigated depth of 400 cm, variant N180P0K0 had highest content of C-HA, exceeding the check variant with 24.9 %. A considerable increase of C-FA according to the check was determined after

systematic application of N180P0K0 – with 60.1 %, of N60P180K0 – with 72.3 %, and of

N180P60K60 – with 70.0 %.

Agricultural Science

The variants with independent introduction of all three nitrogen norms as well as of

phosphorus had more C in HA in comparison to the check, as well as the variants with combinations of the main macro elements. The differentiation with regard to C content in

FA was even better expressed. The check variant and the independent nitrogen fertilization with 60 and 120 kg N/ha had lowest amounts. In all other variants with combinations of the three macro elements, as well as in independent introduction of the highest nitrogen norm, the amount of FA increased. It reached maximum values after systematic application of

N60P180K0, similar to the fraction of aggressive FA. Averaged for this high depth profile, a tendency was observed towards higher HA content as a result from the long-term

systematic mineral fertilization regardless of the norms and ratios of the main macro

elements.

The changes in the content of HA and FA averaged for the 400 cm profile led to distinct

differentiation between the fertilization variants with regard to the values of the ratio HA/FA (Fig.6). Variation was within a wide range: from 1.72 to 3.75. The long-term

systematic nitrogen fertilization with 180 kg N/ha in combination with low fertilization

norms of phosphorus and potassium determined the type of humus as fulvic-humic,

averaged for the investigated depth 0-400 cm. In all other fertilization variants, regardless of the norms and ratios between the macro elements and in the check variant, the values of this ratio were above 2, which determined the type of humus as humic.

The similarities found between the separate fertilization variants with regard to the amount of HA linked to calcium were the reason for the lower rate of differentiation in their values.

Systematic fertilization with N180P60K60 and N120P120K120 led to lower amount of HA-Ca,

below the level of the check and all other investigated fertilization variants (Fig. 7). There was a well expressed tendency towards increase of carbon in HA-Ca as a result from the

independent phosphorus and nitrogen fertilization, regardless of the nitrogen norm.

Averaged for the 400 cm depth, the independent nitrogen fertilization with 180 kg/ha

contributed most to the higher carbon in HA-Ca. The greater amounts of CHA were due to

this higher content of C in the HA fraction linked to calcium.

As a result from the long-term mineral fertilization averaged for the investigated depth, the degree of humification of the organic substance (OS) varied according to the type of the

fertilization variant. The differentiation in the values of this index was extremely high regardless of the similarity and sameness in some of the variants. The 4 m profile had “very high” degree of humification of OS after systematic independent fertilization with 120 and 180 kg N/ha. Only at systematic application of NPK=3:1:1 the rate of humification averaged for the investigated profile was lowest (25.57 %) and according to Orlov and Grishina (1981) can be considered “moderate”. In the other variants the values were 30-40 %, which

determined humification as “high”. It should be noted that in the check variant and in the variant with independent nitrogen fertilization with 60 kg/ha, the humification rate was at the upper limit tending towards “very high”, while in the independent phosphorus

fertilization and in the variants with N60P180K0 and N120P120K120 the values were closer to the lower limit.

Averaged for the tested variants of long-term fertilization, the slightly leached chernozem soil in the trial field can be referred to the low humic type according to the classification of Orlov and Grishina. Ctotal was highest in the 0-20 cm layer (1.62 %) and gradually decreased down the 4-m profile. In the last investigated layer (380-400 cm) its content was 0.26 %, but the 260-280 cm layer had lowest content.

Along the entire investigated profile, organic C was represented by humic acids which

exceeded fulvic acids. The amount of HA was highest in the 0-20 cm layer and gradually

decreased down the profile and at 380-300 cm it was 0.0919 %. Similar to organic carbon

(total humic substances, THS), the amount of HA also slightly increased at depth below 300

cm. The above tendencies remained the same with regard to the changes in FA down the

profile. According to the classification of Orlov and Grishina (1981), the slightly leached chernozem soil in the trial field possessed high to very high content of HA, expressed as percent from the organic C in soil. The values of this ratio were more than 80 % at depth from 20 to 80 cm. They gradually decreased down the profile but nevertheless remained

within 60 – 80 %. The greater part of HA along the entire 400 cm profile was linked to

calcium. Down the profile their amount gradually decreased and in the 220-300 cm zone the lowest concentrations were detected. At the 4th meter their concentration slightly increased.

At depth 40-100 cm the amount of HA-Ca was very high (>80 % of HA). At all other depths the percent of HA-Ca/HA was 60-80 % and can be considered high. The amount of C in HA,

free and linked to R2O3, was lower than the amount of the HA linked to Ca and also slightly decreased down the profile, the lowest values being registered in the 320-340 cm layer

еspecially at N180P60K60 .

2.3.3 Soil organic matter reserves in depth up to 60 cm

The systematic introduction of macro elements at different norms and ratios during a period of 40 years of cultivation of the trial field lead to formation of different reserves of total carbon in soil at depth up to 60 cm with well expressed differentiation (Fig 8). The long-term 2-field agricultural use of the trial field without mineral fertilization was characterized with lowest reserves of total C. The independent nitrogen fertilization with increasing norms

caused their increase according to the check variant with 12.6 %.This increase, however, was lower than the increase registered in all other variants. Highest reserve in absolute values at the moment of taking samples was found in the variants with 40-year fertilization with

N0P180K0 and N60P180K0. The main reason for this fact is that besides the variation in the content of total C, respectively humus, variation in the values of the other component was found when determining reserves – volume density of soil. According to Yankov (2007,

Personal Communication), highest values of volume density averaged for the 0-60 cm layer

were demonstrated by the variant with systematic introduction of phosphorus (180 kg/ha) –

1.43 g/m3, and lowest mean values – by the variant with N180P60K60 (1,22 g/m3). Over 36 %

of the total carbon reserves in soil at depth up to 60 cm were concentrated in the 20-40 cm layer, followed by the layer lying beneath (Table 12). Regardless of the low differentiation in the content of total C down the soil profile up to the 60th cm, the differentiation of the layers according to their reserves was very well expressed. Humus reserves in soil were highest in the 20-40 cm layer. The layer 10-20 cm have a negative C balance according to check variant.

The maximum increase according to the control in 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layer was

established in the variants with N180P0K0 and N0P180K0 (136,3 and 135,6 %, respectively for 0-10 cm layer and 103,2 % and 105,3 % for 10-20 cm layer).

tendency was established also for long-term fertilization with N180P60K60.

3. Conclusion

The systematic mineral fertilization for a period of 40 years with different norms and at different ratios between nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium had high effect on the

agrochemical condition of slightly leached chernozem (Haplic Chernozems) down the soil

profile.

The soil acidity forms, averaged for the investigated depth of the 0-400 cm profile, were significantly affected by the type of fertilizer combination. The depth was the factor with decisive effect in all forms of soil acidity. Influence of mineral fertilization was higher on exchangeable Al3+, Ca2+ and the ∑Са+Mg, and significantly lower - on the values of residual hydrolytic acidity and the rate of alkali saturation. The amount of exchangeable Mg2+ had a clear tendency toward increasing down the soil profile

Independent long-term mineral fertilization with 180 kg N/ha and with N180P60K60 caused

the occurrence of exchangeable Al3+ in the soil absorption complex in the surface layers 0-10

and 10-20 cm. It was not present further down the profile.

The variant with independent nitrogen fertilization with 180 kg/ha has also the lowest

∑Са+Mg and the lowest value of sorption capacity. Intensive mineral fertilization with

N180P60K60 caused decreasing of degree of saturation with bases.

The value of the pH, sorption capacity, acidity on strongly acid positions and degree of

saturation with bases showed a tendency of decreasing at the end of 40th year of trail beginning comparing the end of 30th year. In the same way independently of fertilizer

variant the acidity on the slightly acid positions is strongly increased.

The mineralization ability down the soil profile was affected to a maximum degree of

significance by the mineral fertilization and the incubation. Depth had decisive effect on the value of the index. The maximum effect of this factor was registered after 28-day incubation

– 92.3 %. The role of mineral fertilization on nitrogen mineralization according to the

incubation period was significantly less expressed – 9.2 %, 3.2 5 and 4.0 %, respectively. The amount of nitrified nitrogen increased with the longer incubation periods with 52.7 % (28

days) and with 118.8 % (56 days), respectively, in comparison to 14-day incubation. The

long-term mineral fertilization with N180P60K60 had the highest values of mineralization

ability for all three incubation periods. The established strong effect of systematic mineral fertilization regardless of the norm and ratios of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium on the mineralization ability of soil in comparison to the check variant was highest at depths 0-100

cm and 300 – 400 cm.

Systematic mineral fertilization carried out for 40 years in two-field crop rotation (wheat –

maize) affected the content of Ctotal deep down the profile of the slightly leached chernozem Long-Term Mineral Fertilization and Soil Fertility

117

soil. Systematic use of N180P60K60 contributed most for the increase of its content at average depth 0-400 cm. Fertilizer variants N180P60K60 and N120P120K120 led to lower amount of HA-Ca, below the level of the check and all other investigated fertilization variants. There was a well expressed tendency towards increase of carbon in HA-Ca as a result from the

independent phosphorus and nitrogen fertilization, regardless of the nitrogen norm.

The ratio CHA/CFA putted under average for the 400 cm profile to distinct differentiation between the fertilization variants.Variation was within a wide range: from 1.72 to 3.75. The long-term systematic nitrogen fertilization with 180 kg N/ha in combination with low

fertilization norms of phosphorus and potassium determined the type of humus as fulvic-

humic, averaged for the investigated depth 0-400 cm. In all other fertilization variants, regardless of the norms and ratios between the macro elements and in the check variant, the values of this ratio were above 2, which determined the type of humus as humic.

Independent nitrogen fertilization, especially with annually applied high norms, had a

strong negative effect on the mobility of the organic substance and caused serious decrease of the percent of carbon in the insoluble residue.

As a result from the systematic mineral fertilization in the 20-40 cm layer, higher reserves were formed by the layers lying above and below. Triple NPK combinations (N120P120K120

and N180P60K60) enriched organic mater reserves in 40-60 cm layer.

These results showed that regardless of the intensive agricultural activities and changes of some agrochemical characteristics, slightly leached chernozem soil (Haplic chernozems) in Sough Dobrudzha region in Bulgaria preserved its main genetic characteristics at the lower depths of the soil profile.

The effect of long-term fertilizer treatments on detail nutrient balances, technological quality of crops, concentration of available forms of macro elements and trace elements in soil and plant biomass dynamics and many other aspects of this experiment await detailed analysis.

1. Introduction

1.1 Nitrogen uptake and assimilation

Among the mineral nutrient elements, nitrogen is a kind of macronutrient. Most plant

species are able to absorb and assimilate nitrate (NO3–), ammonium (NH4+), urea and amino acids as nitrogen sources. Most soils do not have sufficient N in available form to support desired production levels. Therefore, addition of N from fertilizer is typically needed to maximize crop yields. Many kinds of N fertilizers are used which contain varying forms of N such as NO3––N, NH4+–N and urea. However, NO3– form of nitrogen is the predominant

form of N absorbed by plants, regardless of the source of applied N (Breteler and Luczak, 1982). This preference is due to several autotrophic soil bacteria, which rapidly oxidize NH4+

to NO2–, and then to NO3– in warm, well–aerated soils. Even though NO3– is the most

available form of N to plants, it can be more readily lost from the root zone because it is very mobile and easy to leach. This economically and environmentally undesirable process

perpetuates a large amount of the uncertainty associated with N fertilizer management

(Pessarakli, 2002).

In the soil solution, nitrate is carried towards the root by bulk flow and is absorbed into the epidermal and cortical symplasm. Within the root symplasm, nitrate has four fates: (1)

reduced to nitrite by the cytoplasmic enzyme nitrate reductase; (2) efflux back across the plasma membrane to the apoplasm; (3) influx and stored in the vacuole; or (4) transported to the xylem for long−distance translocation to the leaves (Andrews, 1986; Ashley et al., 1975; Black et al., 2002; Cooper and Charkson, 1989). Translocated from the xylem, nitrate enters the leaf apoplasm to reach leaf mesophyll cells, where nitrate is again absorbed and either reduced to nitrite or stored in the vacuole.

Nitrate translocated from the roots through the xylem is absorbed by a mesophyll cell via one of the nitrate−proton symporters into the cytoplasm, reduced to nitrite by nitrate

reductase (NR) in the cytoplasm, and then reduced to ammonium by nitrite reductase (NiR)

in the chloroplast, which is then incorporated into amino acids by the glutamine

synthetase−glutamine− 2−oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GS/GOGAT) enzyme system,

giving rise to glutamine (Gln) and ultimately other amino acids and their metabolites (Fig. 1; Taiz and Zeiger, 2002). Therefore, NR, NiR and GS constitute the first three enzymes of the nitrate assimilatory pathway. The NR activity is the limiting step of NO3−–N conversion to amino acid synthesis (Campbell, 1999). In most plant species only a proportion of the

absorbed nitrate is assimilated in the root, the remainder being transported upwards

through the xylem for assimilation in the shoot where it is reduced and incorporated into amino acids (Forde, 2000).

1.2 Availability of amino acids

Traditional models of nutrient cycling assume that organic N matter must be decomposed

by soil microorganisms to release inorganic N, before that N becomes available for plant

uptake. But, there are growing evidences that plant can absorb organic N directly. Earlier studies of nutrient absorption demonstrated that higher plants could take up amino acids

(Virtanen and Linkola, 1946). More recent studies of amino acid absorption have further

focused on the characteristics of the carrier systems and other mechanistic aspects of the uptake process and a wide array of amino acid transporters has been identified in several different plants species (Frommer et al., 1993; Montamat et al., 1999; Neelam et al., 1999).

In the moist tundra of the arctic, inorganic N supplied to plants by mineralization is not sufficient to meet their requirement of N due to low temperatures and anoxic soils. But these soils have large stocks of water–extractable free amino acids (Atkin, 1996). The studies of nitrogen cycling in artic tundra have indicated that some non–mycorrhizal plant species,

such as Eriophorum vaginatum, could absorb amino acids rapidly, accounting for at least 60%

of total the nitrogen absorbed (Chapin et al., 1993). Ectomycorrhizal species have higher amino acid uptake than non–mycorrhizal species (Kielland, 1994). Amino acid uptake was

the general ability found widely in plants from boreal forest (Näsholm et al., 1998; Persson and Näsholm, 2001).

1.3 Amino acids and nitrate uptake

Plants can store high levels of nitrate, or they can translocate it from tissue to tissue without deleterious effect. However, hazardous effects may occur when livestocks and humans

consume plant material with rich nitrate, they may suffer from methemoglobinemia or

carcinoma by converting nitrate to nitrite of nitrosamines. Some countries limit the nitrate content in plant material sold for human consumption.

Several authors reported that free amino acids could down regulate nitrate uptake and

nitrate content in plant. It was found that exogenously supplied amino acids and amides

could decrease the uptake of nitrate by soybean (Muller and Touraine, 1992); wheat

(Rodgers and Barneix, 1993); maize (Ivashikina and Sokolov, 1997; Padgett and Leonard,

1993, 1996; Sivasankar et al., 1997); barley (Aslam et al., 2001)（Table 1）. Plants appear to have multiple mechanisms for regulating nitrate uptake in addition to amino acids or N-status (Padgett and Leonard, 1993).

Work by Breteler and Arnozis (1985) determined that pretreatment of dwarf bean roots with many different individual amino acids inhibited nitrate uptake to varying degrees

dependent upon prior exposure of the plants to nitrogen and the specific amino acid

treatment. No significant effect of amino acids on nitrate transport was detected when both NO3− and amino acids were present in the bathing solution, and no correlation emerged

between inhibition of nitrate uptake and inhibition of nitrate reductase relative to specific amino acids. A more detailed study, presented by Muller and Touraine (1992),

demonstrated inhibition of uptake by 50% or greater by alanine, glutamine, asparagines,

arginine, β–alanine and serine when soybean seedlings were pretreated for 18 h prior to

exposure to NO3−. The mechanisms of inhibition by arginine and alanine appeared to differ, however. Arginine stopped NO3− uptake immediately upon introduction to the uptake

solution, kinetically similar to NH4+ inhibition. The authors suggested that this may be the result of a non-metabolic response such as alteration of membrane potentials. Inhibition by alanine was slower to develop, suggesting a metabolic component to the regulation rather

than a physical or chemical interference.

The N status of the plants could also affect the inhibitory effect of amino acids on nitrate uptake. Rodger and Barneix (1993) had supplied amino acids exogenously to N starved or

non−starved wheat seedlings. Exogenously supplied amino acids and amides had no effect on the wheat seedlings under well nourishment. However, some of the amino acids and amides

supplied seedlings starved of N for 3 days inhibited up to 50% of the nitrate uptake rate.

Agricultural Science

Aslam et al. (2001) had conducted study on differential effect of amino acids (Glu, Asp,

Gln and Asn) on nitrate uptake and reduction systems in barley roots. Similar results

were observed i.e. 50–60% inhibition in the NO3− uptake when the roots were supplied

with 0.1 mM NO3−. However, no inhibition occurred at 10 mM NO3−. In contrast, Kim

(2002) had conducted study on effect of mixed amino acids on nitrate uptake in rice, pea, cucumber and red pepper. The result showed that the effect of mixed amino acids (MAA)

on nitrate uptake in nutrient solution was unaffected in low MAA concentration and

accelerated in high MAA concentration. The results indicated that external MAA could

regulate nitrate uptake.

1.4 Amino acids and enzyme regulation

Nitrate reductase (NR) is a substrate inducible enzyme involved in the nitrate assimilation in higher plant, and the enzyme occupying a control point in the pathway of nitrate

assimilation. Activity of the NR fluctuates widely in response to many environmental or physiological factors, such as the presence of NH4+ or amino acids in the growth medium. In studies of the possible regulation of NR activity by amino acids in higher plants, the results have often been conflicting. For example, Radin (1975, 1977) had shown that the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in cotton roots is inhibited by specific amino acids. On the other hand, Oaks (1977) had found using an in vitro assay those amino acids results in enhanced levels of NR

and also cause only minor inhibitions in both intact and excised corn roots. Aslam et al.

(2001) reported that the amino acids partially inhibited (35%) the induction of nitrate

reductase activity (NRA) in barley roots supplied with 0.1 mM NO3−, but no inhibition

occurred at 10 mM NO3−. He has concluded that the inhibition of induction of NRA by the

amino acids is a result of the lack of substrate availability due to inhibition of the NO3−

uptake system at low NO3− supply. It has been suggested that glutamate inhibited NRA in

roots, but not in shoots (Ivashikina and Sokolov, 1997). This inhibition seems be dependent on plant materials, age of plants, growth conditions, nitrate concentration, amino acid kinds, amino acids concentration and other factors.

Effect of amino acids on the regulation of NR gene expression has been studied at the

molecular level. Deng et al. (1991) reported that the addition of 5 mM glutamine to the

nutrient solution of tobacco plants grown in 1 mM NO3− resulted in a pronounced inhibition of NR mRNA accumulation in the roots. Vincentz et al. (1993) showed, under low light

conditions (limiting photo synthetic conditions), the supply of glutamine or glutamate led to a drop in the level of NR mRNA, while glutamine and glutamate were less efficient at

decreasing NiR mRNA than NR mRNA levels. Li et al. (1995) also demonstrated that 5 mM

glutamine added together with NO3− resulted in reduced levels of NR mRNA in both root

and shoot of maize. Sivasankar et al. (1997) observed that Gln and asparagine (Asn)

inhibited the induction of NR activity (NRA) in corn roots at an external supply of 250 M

and 5 mM NO3−. They concluded that inhibition was not the result of altered NO3− uptake,

and tissue nitrate accumulation was reduced at 250 M external nitrate in the presence of 1mM Asn, but not at 5mM Asn.

In the studies of the possible regulation of NR activity by multiple amino acids in higher plants, the conclusions are again contradictory. The inhibition on NR activity by glycine, asparagines, and glutamine could be partially or wholly prevented by the presence of other Effect of Mixed Amino Acids on Crop Growth

123

amino acids during the induction (Radin, 1977). However when glutamine and asparagine

were included along with the “corn amino acid mixture”, the inhibition on the induction of NR in corn roots was more severe (Oaks et al., 1977). Chen and Gao (2002) have applied

different mixture of glycine, isoleucine and proline replacing nitrate of solution partially (20%) to Chinese cabbage and lettuce in hydroponics. Amino acids enhanced the NR activity in Chinese cabbage, while it decreased in lettuce.

1.5 Influence on yield and N assimilation

L−tryptophan, considered as a physiological precursor of auxins in higher plants, was

applied to soil to evaluate its influence on yield of several crops. Kucharski and Nowak

(1994) found that L−tryptophan did not affect the yield of above ground part and roots of field bean. On the other hand, positive effects on corn and cabbage growth were reported

(Sarwar and Frankenberger, 1994; Chen et al., 1997).

Amino acids were used to partially replace NO3− or foliar spray in many plants. In most

case, the application of amino acids led to decreased nitrate content and increased total nitrogen content in lettuce, Chinese cabbage, onion, pakchoi or other leafy crops (Gunes et al., 1994, 1996; Chen and Gao, 2002; Wang et al., 2004). Some authors suggested that plants probably preferred amino acids as sources of reduced nitrogen, and nitrate uptake was

inhibited by amino acids. In fact, there was little evidence or data to support the

conclusions. It has not been distinguished that increased total nitrogen came of nitrate or amino acids.

1.6 Objectives

Regulation of induction of the NO3− uptake and reduction systems by nitrogen metabolites

has been attributed to feed−back inhibition (Pal’ove−Balang, 2002). It was found that nitrate uptake rate follows a biphasic relationship with external nitrate concentration, suggesting the existence of at least two different uptake systems (Cerezo et al., 2000). At high external nitrate concentration (> 0.5 mM), a low affinity transport system (LATS), which shows linear kinetics, contributes significantly to the uptake rate and appears to be constitutively

expressed and essentially unregulated. At low external concentrations (< 0.5 mM), two high affinity transport systems (HATS) operate, one of these being constitutive whereas the other is induced by nitrate. The HATS for nitrate uptake is sensitive to metabolic inhibitors and appears to be an active transport system (Daniel−Vedele et al., 1998).

Although the regulatory effect of amino acids on nitrate uptake and NR has been examined

extensively, its effect on GS has not been examined in detail. Otherwise, a lot of amino acids were investigated about their regulation on nitrate uptake and assimilation, but very little information has been reported about effect of mixed amino acids (MAA).

In fact, there are two possible reasons for the increase of total N content in the plants: preference for amino acids as sources of reduced nitrogen and regulation of amino acids on inorganic nitrogen uptake and assimilation.

The solution experiments were carried out to investigate the regulation of the induction of NO3– uptake, NRA, NiRA and GSA in radish and red pepper by applying mixed amino

Agricultural Science

acids (MAA) under the conventional fertilization. These two plants were selected because

radish is NO3– preferred crop and red pepper is NH4+ preferred crop. The amino acids used in this experiment were alanine (Ala), β–alanine (β–Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), asparagine (Asn), glutamic acid (Glu), glutamine (Gln) and glycine (Gly). These amino acids were

selected for the reasons include: (1) their structural role in proteins, (2) significant effect on NO3– uptake which was found in many works, and (3) considerable amounts in plant

phloem and xylem (Caputo and Barneix, 1997; Lohaus et al., 1997; Peeters and Van Laere,

1994; Winter et al., 1992).

In the frame of the studies on the effect of the mixed amino acids (MAA) on nitrate uptake and assimilation, the pot experiments were focused on the role of MAA in process of NO3–

uptake and assimilation. In order to distinguish the origin of N in radish, 15N labeled nitrate was used.

In order to develop an approach for more efficient N fertilizer use and to prevent

environmental pollution due to nitrate leaching, the aim of the study presented here, is to investigate the effect of amino acid fertilizer (AAF) on nitrate removal in high nitrate soils.

2.2 Results and discussion

2.2.1 Effect on NO –

3 uptake

The MAA treatments showed different effect on nitrate uptake depending on the

concentrations (Fig. 2). The NO3– uptake in treatment A1 was similar to that of A0 after 8 h exposure to NO3–. However, exposure for longer hours (16 or 24 h) to 0.3 mM MAA

inhibited the NO3– uptake by 38% compared with A0. In contrast, the highest NO3– uptake

was found in treatment A2 that showed 305% higher than A0.

Several authors reported that free amino acids could down regulate NO3– uptake. It was

found that exogenously supplied amino acids and amides could decrease the uptake of

NO3– by soybean (Muller and Touraine, 1992); wheat (Rodgers and Barneix, 1993); maize

(Ivashikian and Sokolov, 1997; Padgett and Leonard, 1996; Sivasankar et al., 1997); barley (Aslam et al., 2001). In this experiment, the effectiveness of the MAA treatments on NO3–

uptake was similar to above references at low MAA treatment rate (0.3 mM MAA, Fig. 2).

However, contrary result was found at high MAA treatment rate (3.0 mM MAA, Fig. 2), in





126

Agricultural Science

which NO3– uptake was 4–fold higher than the control. This result was similar to rice, pea, cucumber and red pepper, which were treated with 5.0 mM MAA (Kim, 2002).

The effect on nitrate uptake seems to respond to kinds and concentration of amino acids.

Muller and Touraine (1992) had examined the effect of 14 different amino acids on nitrate uptake in soybean seedlings supplied with 0.5 mM nitrate. After 10 mM single amino acid

pretreatment, about half of the tested amino acids had a substantial inhibitory effect on nitrate uptake, mainly Ala, Glu (almost 100% inhibition), Asn and Arg (about 80%), and

Asp, Ala, Scr, and Gln (from 70% to 48%). However, when supplied at 100 mM amino acid

to the tip−cut cotyledons, only eight of fourteen amino acids had inhibitory effect, and four amino acids had enhanced nitrate uptake.

2.2.2 Effect on NO –

–

3 and NO2 accumulation

The application of MAA increased the NO3– concentrations both in shoots and in roots

regardless of application rates (Table 4), resulting in the highest concentration in A1 and the lowest concentration in A0. The high concentration of NO3– in A2 was attributed to the high NR activity (Fig. 3). Although A1 treatment showed the lowest uptake of NO3– (Fig. 2), the highest concentration of NO3– was found by the reason of that low NR activity in A1 (Fig. 3) led to a blocking of the reduction of NO3– to NO2–. With respect to the NO2– values (Table 4), in our experiments, the highest NO2– concentrations in both shoots and roots were found in the A2. In shoots, the lowest NO2– concentration was found in A1 and the lowest in A0 in

roots.

Table 4. Effect of mixed amino acids on NO3– and NO2– concentration in fresh weight of

radish at 24 h after treatment

Although many authors agree that amino acid can negatively regulate nitrate content in

higher plants (Chen and Gao, 2002; Gunes et al., 1994, 1996; Wang et al., 2004), the results in the present experiment do not support this interpretation. Both in shoots and in roots, the MAA used in this study led to little increase of NO3– concentrations (Table 4). The

contradiction may reside in treatment method and treatment period of amino acids. It was

demonstrated in other studies that amino acid pretreatment decreased NO3– accumulation

slightly, but Gln and Asn increased the NO3– concentration in barley roots when they were used together with nitrate (Aslam et al., 2001). The reason of difference between this

experiment and others is that NO3– content of shoots includes portion of NO3– in xylem sap.

Concentrations of NO3– in xylem sap can be quite high, especially in plants that transport most of the NO3– taken up to the shoot for reduction (e.g., maize 10.5 mM, Oaks, 1986;

barley 27 to 34 mM, Lews et al., 1982).



Effect of Mixed Amino Acids on Crop Growth

127

As interim product of NO3– assimilation procedure, the concentration of NO2– depended on

the reduction rate of nitrate and nitrite. The highest concentration of NO2– found in A2

(Table 4) was due to high NR activity (Fig. 3), and the lowest concentration of NO2– in

shoots in A1 (Table 4) was due to low NR activity (Fig. 3) too. However, low NiR activity (Fig. 4) led to a blocking of the reduction of NO2– to NH4+ in roots in A1, so that

concentration of NO2– showed higher than A0 (Table 4).

2.2.3 Effect on NRA, NiRA and GSA

For NO3– assimilation, NO3– is reduced to NO2– by catalysis of NR. In this experiment, low concentration and high concentration of MAA treatments led to different effects on NR

activity (Fig. 3). Both in the shoots and in the roots NR activities were inhibited slightly in A1. Significant increases of NR activities were found in A2 treatment, with 75% in shoots and 340% in roots respectively, relative to A0.

There are contradictory results for the possible regulation of NR activity by amino acids for higher plants. For example, Radin (1975, 1977) has shown that the reduction of NO3– to NO2– in cotton roots is inhibited by specific amino acids. On the other hand, Oaks et al.

(1979) have found that amino acids inhibited minor levels of NR in both intact and excised corn roots using an in vitro assay. Aslam et al., (2001) reported that the amino acids partially inhibited the increase of NR activity in barley roots where most NO3– uptake was facilitated via high affinity transport system (HATS) but had little effect where low

affinity transport system (LATS) is operative. It has been suggested that glutamate

inhibited NR activity in roots, but no inhibition in shoots (Ivashikian and Sokolov, 1997).

Sivasankar et al. (1997) observed that Gln and asparagine (Asn) inhibited the induction of NR activity in corn roots at both 250 M and 5 mM of external NO3– supply. They

concluded that inhibition was not the result of altered NO3– uptake, and tissue nitrate

accumulation was reduced at 250 M external nitrate in the presence of 1 mM Asn, but

not at 5 mM Asn.

Agricultural Science

In the studies of the possible regulation of NR activity by multiple amino acids in higher plants, the conclusions are also contradictory. The inhibition on NR activity by glycine, asparagines, and glutamine could be partially or wholly prevented by the presence of other amino acids during the induction (Radin, 1977). However when glutamine and asparagines

were included along with the “corn amino acid mixture”, the inhibition on the induction of NR in corn roots was more severe (Oaks et al., 1979). Chen and Gao (2002) have applied

different mixture of glycine, isoleucine and proline to Chinese cabbage and lettuce in

hydroponic experiment. They found the amino acids treatment enhanced NR activity in

Chinese cabbage, while decreasing it slightly in lettuce.

In this experiment, at 5.0 mM NO3– which is facilitated by LATS, the presence of 0.3 mM

MAA partially inhibited NR activity, as observed in other works, whereas the 3.0 mM MAA

increased the NR activity more than 4 times (Fig. 3). In addition, the very high NO2– content was found in A2 (Table 4). These results suggest that high concentration MAA can increase NO3– uptake by enhancing NR activity in radish, especially in roots.

The next step in NO3– assimilation is the conversion of NO2– to NH4+ by the action of NiR.

Both enzymes, NR and NiR, are induced by the same factors, and therefore the response

of NiR to the MAA treatments resembled that of NR in roots, but was a little different

with that of the NR in shoots (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). NiR activities in shoots and roots in A1

were inhibited by 17% and 52% respectively in relation to A0. In A2, NiR activity was

inhibited by 15% in shoots and enhanced 8 times in roots. In the present study, the

decrease of NiR activity in shoots in A2 might be attributed to the low concentration of

amino acids in shoots, too. The increase of NiR activity in roots in A2 was due to the same reason with NR.

The principal NH4+ pathway is the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase

(GOGAT) cycle. The behavior of GS activities in shoots was not affected by MAA treatments (Fig. 5). However differences were found in roots between treatments, showing 22%

inhibition in A1 and 17% increase in A2 in relation to A0.



Effect of Mixed Amino Acids on Crop Growth

129

The NH4+ originating in the plant from NO3– reduction is incorporated into an organic form primarily by the enzyme GS. In the present experiment, GS activity was inhibited by 0.3 mM

MAA treatment in radish roots, whereas 3.0 mM of MAA treatment enhanced the activity (Fig.

5). It is also striking that effect of MAA on NO3– assimilation in the roots was higher than in the shoots, presumably NO3– was more available and the MAA content was higher in the roots.

The results of the present experiment clearly indicated that NO3– uptake and NO3– assimilation was regulated by MAA in radish, especially at high concentration of MAA treatment. In

conclusion, the application of high MAA rates (principally A2) could be the direct cause of increased activities of the three enzymes (NR, NiR and GS) of the NO3− assimilatory pathway and the NO3– uptake was enhanced when supplied with LATS range of NO3–.

3. Hydroponic experiment of red pepper

3.1 Materials and methods

Seeds of Chongok red pepper ( Capsicum annuum) were sown in February 2005. The seedlings were grown in individual pots filled with commercialized artificial soil in an

experimental greenhouse for 35 days and then transferred to 50 mL plastic tubes containing 20 mL inorganic nutrient solution. The nutrient solution was renewed every day. The

composition of the inorganic nutrient solution and the cultural condition were the same

with hydroponic experiment of radish.

The mixed amino acids (MAA) solution was the same with that used in hydroponic

experiment of radish which contained 7 equal concentrations of amino acids. At 7 days after transferring, red pepper seedlings were placed in inorganic nutrient solution containing 1.0

mM NO3– and 0, 0.3 or 3.0 mM MAA, as indicated in Table 5. The pH of the nutrient

solutions were maintained between 6.0–6.1 by adding 1.0 M KOH appropriately. The

nutrient solutions were renewed at 4, 8, and 16 h, respectively.

The MAA treatments showed different effect on nitrate uptake depending on the

concentrations (Fig. 6). Application of MAA at both 0.3 mM and 3.0 mM concentrations

increased NO3– uptake in red pepper ( P < 0.001) and the highest NO3– uptake was found in treatment A2 showing 7 fold increases over A0.

3.2.3 Effect on NRA, NiRA and GSA

For NO3– assimilation, NO3– is reduced to NO2– by catalysis of NR. In this experiment, MAA treatments led to different effects on NR activity in leaves and in roots (Fig. 7). In the roots, treatment A1 and treatment A2 showed increases of 35% and 212% respectively in relation

to A0 ( P < 0.01). In contrast, NR activities were inhibited slightly in leaves by MAA treatments, showing 8.2% in A1 and 10.5% in A2, respectively ( P > 0.05).

The response of NiR to the MAA treatments resembled that of NR in roots, but was different with that of the NR in leaves (Fig. 8). NiR activities in leaves and roots in A1 were increased by 18% and 60% respectively in relation to A0 (leaves: P < 0.05; roots: P < 0.01). In A2, NiR

activities were the same with A0 in leaves and enhanced 138% in roots (leaves: P > 0.05; roots: P < 0.01).

The first step in nitrate assimilation is the reduction of NO3– to NO2– by NR, the main and most limiting step, in addition to being the most prone to regulation (Sivasankar et al., 1997; Ruiz et al., 1999). The next step in NO3– assimilation is the conversion of the NO2– to NH4+

by the action of NiR. Both enzymes, NR and NiR, are induced by the same factors (Oaks,

1994). In our experiment, at 10 mM NO3– which is facilitated by LATS, the presence of MAA could increase the activities of NR and NiR in roots (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). In addition, the very high NO2– content was found in MAA treatments in roots (Table 6). These results suggest

that MAA can increase NO3– uptake by enhancing NR activity in roots of red pepper. It is



Effect of Mixed Amino Acids on Crop Growth

133

also striking that effect of MAA on NO3– assimilation in the roots was higher than in the leaves, presumably NO3– was more available and the MAA content was higher in the roots.

Ammonium assimilation in higher plants was long thought to begin with the synthesis of

glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). It is now believed that the major pathway of

NH4+ assimilation is the GS-GOGAT pathway, and GDH generally acts in a deaminating

direction (Milflin and Habash, 2001). However, a role in NH4+ detoxification would explain the increase in GDH expression under conditions that provoke high tissue NH4+ levels

(Lancien et al., 2000).

Two possible effect ways of amino acids on N assimilation process had been suggested:

direct effect on mRNA of NR (Deng et al., 1991; Li et al., 1995; Vincentz et al., 1993) and feed–back inhibition on NO3– reduction systems (King et al., 1993; Ivashikian and Sokolov, 1997; Sivasankar et al., 1997). The hypothesis is that these two effect ways can collectively influence N assimilation in higher plant. This might probably be the main reason for

differential effects on NO3– uptake observed in different studies. In the present experiment, GS activity was inhibited slightly by MAA treatments in roots, whereas irregular results

were obtained in leaves (Fig. 9).

3.2.4 Effect on amino acids and proteins accumulation

With respect to the main products of NO3– assimilation, amino acids and proteins (Table 7), the plants treated with MAA did not show increase in these compounds as being supposed

apart from amino acids in roots ( P < 0.05). In contrast, the concentration of proteins in the roots ( P < 0.05) and leaves ( P > 0.05) decreased with the MAA rate. Amino acids in leaves ( P

> 0.05) showed the same tendency too.

Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins and also the products of their hydrolysis (Barneix and Causin, 1996). In the present experiment, amino acids concentrations (Table 7) were higher in the roots than in leaves. This is normal since the N assimilation occurs

primarily in the roots than in the leaves. In roots, proteins concentrations (Table 7) were decreased by MAA treatment due to the possibility that amino acids content had effect on

protein breakdown.

In conclusion, the results of the present experiment clearly indicated that NO3– uptake

and NO3– assimilation were regulated by MAA in red pepper. The application of MAA

rates could be the direct cause of increased activities of the enzymes (NR and NiR) of the NO3– assimilatory pathway and the NO3– uptake was enhanced when supplied with





134

LATS range of NO3–. In addition, NO3– uptake by red pepper in unit weight plant was

less than that of radish due to the different preference on N form between these two

plants.

4. Pot experiment of radish with high NO –

3 soil

4.1 Materials and methods

Commercialized artificial soil (pH, 5.2; EC, 1240 mS m–1; NO3––N, 280 mg Kg–1; available

P2O5, 1020 mg Kg–1) was mixed with 15N labeled potassium nitrate (10 atom % 15N) and

incubated at room temperature for 14 days at 60% of their maximum water–holding

capacity. Finally, the high nitrate soil (pH, 5.0; EC, 3230 mS m–1; NO3––N, 1906 mg Kg–1; available P2O5, 1060 mg Kg–1) was obtained and used for this experiment. Seeds of radish

were sown into 100 mL pots filled with the incubated soil and grown in a glasshouse.

The mixed amino acids (MAA) solution contained equal concentrations of amino acids

viz., alanine (Ala), β–alanine (β–Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), asparagines (Asn), glutamic acid (Glu), glutamine (Gln) and glycine (Gly). From 17 or 24 days after sowing, seedlings of

radish were sprayed with 0.2 or 0.5 mM MAA solution for 2 or 4 times, as indicated in

Table 8. The pH of the MAA solutions was maintained between 6.0–6.1 by adding 1.0 M

KOH appropriately.

Fresh leaves were collected at 28 days after sowing to determine the NO3– content and

enzyme activities and at 30 days after sowing to determine the NO3–, amino acids and

protein contents. Plant shoots were harvested at 30 days after sowing to determine crop

yield and N assimilation. After harvest the soils were collected for chemical analysis.

4.2 Results and discussion

4.2.1 Effect of MAA on enzyme activities

Nitrate reductase is the first enzyme involved in the metabolic route of NO3– assimilation in higher plants. Significant differences were found in the NR activity between the

treatments ( P < 0.01) (Fig. 10). The highest activity was attained with A2, showing an increase of 30% compared with the activity attained with A0. Treatment A1 and A3 were

less effective in increasing the activity of NR than A2, with increase of 21% and 7%,

respectively.

The response of GS to MAA treatments is showed in Fig. 12. The greatest activity was observed in treatment A2, with an increase of 7% over the reference treatment ( P > 0.1). On the contrary, the least activity of GS was found in A1, with a 12% decrease compared with A0 ( P < 0.05).

The results of activities of enzymes are similar to those of other research, which indicated that treatment of MAA (Section 3.1) and amino acid fertilizer (Section 3.7) could enhance activity of NR in radish when supplied with high rate NO3–. In the present experiment, the treatments of MAA led to different rates of increase in NR activity and also affect NiR and GS activities depending on applied rates. Higher activities of three enzymes were found in A2 for the reason that the positive effect on NR was stronger than the feed–back inhibition.

However, decrease of NiR and GS was observed in A1 due to the feed–back inhibition on

NO3– reduction systems which affected GS first.

4.2.2 Effect of MAA on N contents

The data in Table 9 showed that N contents of the plants were affected by using MAA. The

NO3– content of radish was decreased by 24–38% by applying MAA ( P < 0.001) compared with the reference treatment.

Effect of Mixed Amino Acids on Crop Growth

137

With respect to the main products of NO3– assimilation, amino acids and proteins (Table 9), the plants treated with MAA showed a little increase of these compounds ( P > 0.05) and the highest contents were found in A2.

The total N content of the plants was affected significantly by using MAA ( P < 0.01).

Treatments of A1, A2 and A3 showed to decrease the total N content to 14%, 7% and 10%

compared with the control, respectively.

The result of NO3– content agrees with the interpretation that amino acid can negatively

regulate nitrate content in higher plants (Chen and Gao, 2002; Gunes et al., 1994, 1996; Wang et al., 2004). In the present experiment, surged value of NO3– content was also found at 24 h after MAA treating (the data were not shown). This was probably due to the different

response of individual plant to the complex mechanism of MAA in NO3– assimilation

process in short period. However, 3 days after MAA application, regular result of NO3–

content in shoots of radish was found.

The predominance of amino acids and proteins were attributed to high activities of main

enzymes of NO3– assimilation and the direct uptake of amino acids from MAA.

The result of total N content was opposite from that of field experiment in which total N

content was increased by applying amino acid fertilizer. These contradictory results were due to different stage of amino acids treatment. Possibly, young plants may lack a complete functional system for NO3– uptake and assimilation (Pessarakli, 2002). Wang et al. (2004) reported that application of amino acids in autumn could increase total N in pakchoi but no significant effect was observed when treated in summer.

4.2.3 Effect of MAA on radish yield and N utilization

The plant production in terms of fresh weight was found to be significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in treatment A1 and A2, with increases of 13% and 12% compared with the control,

respectively (Table 10). The response of production in dry weight to MAA treatments was

more sensitive than that of fresh weight (Table 10), with significant influences in MAA

application ( P < 0.01). The highest yield in dry weight was found in A2, with an increase of 44% in relation to A0. The results of N utilization (Table 10) were similar to dry yield

described above, again registering the highest value in A2, with an increase of 34%

compared with A0 ( P < 0.01). Furthermore, significant effects were also observed in A1 and A3, with increase of 27% and 13% respectively, relative to A0 ( P < 0.01).

Agricultural Science

For responses of growth, the application of MAA showed enhanced effects obviously. These

results are in agreement with those observed by Chen et al. (1997), who reported that

application of amino acids led to positive effects on Chinese cabbage growth. Among the

treatments of MAA, the growth responses were increased by increasing the application rate of MAA. The increases of yield were due to the positive adjusting of MAA on growth of

plants, thus contributing to the increases of N utilization (Table 10) even though the total N

content was decreased in MAA treatments (Table 9).

4.2.4 Recovered fertilizer nitrogen

It has become evident that amino acids are a principal source of nitrogen for certain plants, such as mycorrihizal, heathland species (Read, 1993), non–mycorrihizal plants from arctic and alpine ecosystems (Chapin et al., 1993; Kielland, 1994) and boreal forest plants

(Näsholm et al., 1998; Persson and Näsholm, 2001). These systems are similar in that N

mineralization rates are heavily constrained by climate, and plant N demands cannot be met through the uptake of inorganic ions (Raab et al., 1999). Based on these researches, the

amino acids were used to partially replace NO3– in hydroponic experiment or spray to

leaves in many plants. In most case, the application of amino acids led to the decrease of nitrate content and total nitrogen content in lettuce, Chinese cabbage, onion, pakchoi or other leafy crops (Chen and Gao, 2002; Gunes et al., 1994, 1996; Wang et al., 2004). It had been suggested that plants probably preferred amino acids as sources of reduced nitrogen, and nitrate uptake was inhibited by amino acids.

In this study, the high NdfF was found in MAA treatments (Table 11), indicating that applied MAA did not act as a source of nitrogen for plants. On the contrary, plants had taken up more NO3––N from soil due to the regulation of MAA on NO3– uptake and assimilation. The results for the possible regulation of NO3– uptake and assimilation by amino acids for higher plants are contradictory. Many authors agreed that amino acids can down regulate the NO3– uptake and assimilation in higher plants (Aslam et al., 2001; Ivashikian and Sokolov, 1997; Oaks et al., 1979; Radin, 1975, 1977; Sivasankar et al., 1997). But Aslam et al. (2001) reported that inhibition did not occur when the concentration of NO3– in the external solutions had been increased to 10 mM. This result is consistent with the other research, which indicated that radish treated with mixed amino acids containing 5.0 mM NO3– in growth medium show significantly

increased the NO3– uptake. In this experiment, the positive effect on NO3– uptake by applying MAA was due to very high NO3– content in soil (1906 mg Kg–1).

4.2.5 Effect of MAA on chemical properties of soil

The chemical properties of soil at the end of experiment are showed in Table 12. The

planting of radish affected these chemical properties of soil clearly. However, there were no differences in pH of soil among treatments planted with radish. On the other hand, either planting treatment or MAA treatment showed effect on nitrate in soil. Compared with the

non planting treatment, the treatments of planting showed a decrease of 65~81% and

35~47% of nitrate and available P at 30 days after sowing, respectively. The different rates of decrease were due to the different growth rates led by MAA treatment.

* The soil used in these experiments was commercialized artificial soil with lower soil density (about 0.4

g cm–3) and higher water–holding capacity. Since determination of soil chemical properties is based on dry weight, the determined values of EC and NO3––N are quite high relative to ordinary soil. However, these are not very higher in soil solution.

Table 12. Chemical properties of soil at the end of pot experiment for radish with high NO3–

soil

In conclusion, the results of the present experiment suggest that application of MAA can

affect activities of three enzymes of N assimilation (NR, NiR and GS). However, the exact reason for this observation is unknown and further investigation is necessary. Furthermore, the application of MAA can enhance growth, N utilization, and concentrations of proteins

and amino acids, and reduce the NO3– content in plant shoots. Considerable increase of N

uptake from soil was indicated by the increased 15N recovery by applying MAA compared

with the control. These results suggest that the main role of MAA on nitrate uptake and

assimilation might be relation with the regulation of NO3– uptake and assimilation, but not as sources of reduced nitrogen.

5.2 Results and discussion

5.2.1 Effect of MAA on enzyme activities

Significant differences were found in the NR activity among the treatments ( P < 0.01) (Fig.

13). The NR activity was inhibited by foliar application of MAA in this experiment, contrary to that of radish in which was planted in high nitrate soil. The lowest activity was attained with A2, showing a decrease of 28% compared with the activity attained in treatment A0.

Treatment A1 and A3 were less effective in decreasing the activity of NR than A2, with

decreases of 8% and 17%, respectively.

With respect to enzyme activity of GS (Fig. 15), the application of MAA led to significant decrease in the activity in leaves of radish in this experiment, the lowest activity being recorded in treatment A1, with a decrease of 27% in relation to the highest activity, found in the reference treatment A0 ( P > 0.01). Treatment A2 and A3 also showed decreases of 22%

and 26%, respectively.

Like some of the N transporters, NR is induced by its own substrate, NO3–, and this

induction is fast, occurring within several minutes, and requires very low concentrations (< 10 μM) (Craw ford, 1995; Sueyoshi et al., 1995). NO3– is the primary factor, although other factors also influence the regulation of NO3– reduction and assimilation, including the end–

products of assimilation such as amino acids. NiR and NR are similarly transcriptionally

regulated for the reason of that NiR is strongly induced by the same factor, NO3–, probably to prevent the accumulation of toxic NO2– (Wang et al., 2000). The activities of NR and NiR

were much lower than that of radish which was planted in high NO3– soil due to the poor

NO3– in the soil used in the present experiment (Table 15).

In the present experiment, the activities of three enzymes decreased when treated with

MAA. These results are in agreement with other researches which indicated that

downstream N assimilation products such as amino acids can feed back to regulate NO3–

uptake and reduction (Deng et al., 1991; Sivasanker et al., 1997; Vincentz et al., 1993).

However, the effects of MAA on activities of enzymes are opposite to other experiments of ours, which indicated that treatment of MAA and amino acid fertilizer could enhance

activity of NR in radish when supplied with high rate of NO3–. The contradictory results are due to the different NO3– levels of the soils.

5.2.2 Effect of MAA on N contents

The data in Table 13 showed that N contents of the plants were not affected significantly by using MAA. The highest concentrations of all N forms were observed in treatment A2 ( P > 0.05). These results differed from radish which was planted in high NO3– soil. The different 142

effects of MAA on N contents of radish in high NO3– soil and low NO3– soil are in agreement with the supposition that amino acids have different effect on NO3– uptake and assimilation.

5.2.3 Effect of MAA on radish yield and N utilization

The plant production in fresh weight was found to be higher ( P < 0.01) in treatment of A2, with an increase of 9% compared with the control treatment (Table 14). The response of production in dry weight to MAA treatments was not as sensitive as that in fresh weight (Table 14), only with slight influences. The results of N utilization (Table 14) were similar to dry yield, registering the highest value in A1, with an increase of 15% compared with A0 ( P < 0.01).

5.2.4 Effect of MAA on chemical properties of soil

The chemical properties of soil at the end of experiment were showed in Table 15. The

planting of radish affected these chemical properties of soil clearly. However, there were no differences in pH of soil among treatments planted with radish. On the other hand, either planting treatment or MAA treatment showed effect on soil nitrate reduction. Compared

with the non planting treatment, the treatments of planting showed decrease of 86~88% for nitrate and decrease of 56~70% for available P at 30 days after sowing, respectively. The different rates of decrease were due to the different growth rates resulted from by MAA

treatment. And the EC decreased accordingly.

Table 15. Chemical properties of soil at the end of pot experiment for radish with low NO3– soil The commercialized artificial soil used in this experiment was with lower soil density (about 0.4 g cm–3) and higher water–holding capacity. Although the NO3– contents of 62.2~70.3 mg Kg–1 are not low in ordinary soil, available NO3– for plants is very poor in soil solution in this experiment. This might be the probable reason, that effects of MAA on N assimilation in the present experiment were different from that of radish which was planted in high NO3–

soil. Whether in our experiments or in other researches, different effects of amino acids on NO3– reduction and assimilation were observed (Aslam et al., 2001).

In conclusion, the results of the present experiment suggest that application of MAA can

decrease activities of three enzymes of N assimilation (NR, NiR and GS). However, except N

utilization, the application of MAA did not have significant effects on growth, and

concentrations of proteins, amino acids, total N and NO3– content in plant shoots. The

difference in the results were found in both the present experiment and pot experiment

which radish was planted in high NO3– soil may be due to different levels of NO3– content in soil solution. The hypothesis that effect of amino acids on NO3– uptake, reduction and

assimilation depends on concentration of NO3– was justified.

6. Field experiment of radish

6.1 Materials and methods

The study was conducted in summer of 2005 at the experimental farm of the Chungnam

National University, Daejeon, Korea. The average chemical properties of the soil of the field are described in Table 16. The fertilizer mixture was uniformly broadcasted onto the soil surface and incorporated before ridging. The seeds of radish were sown at the end of May

2005 and arranged in a completely randomized block design, with three replications. The

plots were 5 m × 2 m consisting of 2 rows.

At 15 and 22 days after sowing, AAF was applied 2 times to plots by spraying to leaves after diluting 500, 1000 and 2000 times by water, respectively. The main chemical contents of the AAF and application quantities are shown in Table 17.

Agricultural Science

Fresh leaves were collected at 23 days after sowing to determine the NO3–, amino acids and protein contents and enzyme activities. The plots were harvested at 35 days after sowing to determine crop yield and N assimilation. The topsoil samples (0–20 cm) were collected at 25

and 35 days after sowing for chemical analysis.

In order to compare the different AAF treatments for their N uptake, net N uptake was

estimated by balancing N utilization and N input by applying AAF thus:



N 



N

NU NAAF . (1)

where NN is the net N uptake by plant; NU is the total N utilization at harvest; NAAF is N

input by applying AAF.

It was assumed that N would have been either taken up by the plants or lost from the soil–

plant system. In our experiment, leaching was the main way of N loss. Furthermore, N loss attributable to soil erosion and runoff was considered for our site with 2~5% slope. Since these losses may be influenced by protecting of the plants from the rain, the vegetation

cover was observed at 25 and 35 days after sowing.

6.2 Results and discussion

6.2.1 Effect of AAF on enzyme activities

Nitrate reductase is the first enzyme involved in the metabolic route of NO3– assimilation in higher plants. Significant differences were found in the NR activity between the treatments ( P < 0.01) (Fig. 16). The highest activity was obtained with A1, showing an increase of 16%

in relation to the activity obtained with A0. A2 was less effective in increasing the activity of NR than A1; whereas no increase of NRA occurred in A3, even treated with fourfold AAF

than A1.

The next step in NO3– assimilation is the conversion of the NO2– to NH4+ by the action of NiR. The AAF treatments showed different effect on NiR activity depending on the applied

rate of AAF (Fig. 17). The highest activity of NiR was found in treatment A1, showing an

increase of 4% compared with A0 ( P < 0.05). However, the activities of NiR were inhibited by 12 and 13% in A2 and A3, respectively.

The reversible amination of 2–oxoglutarate to glutamic acid via GDH has long been

considered as a major route of NH4+ assimilation (Srivastava and Singh, 1987). However the discovery of the enzyme GS–GOGAT system altered this point of view, and the

incorporation of NH4+ to glutamine via GS and subsequently into glutamic acid by GOGAT

is now widely accepted as the main route of NH4+ assimilation (Oaks, 1994). The response of GS (Fig. 18) to AAF treatments was similar to that of the NiR (Fig. 17). The greatest activity was reached in treatment A1, with an increase of 20% over the reference treatment ( P < 0.001). On the contrary, the activity of GS was the lowest in A3, with a decline of 11%

compared with A0 ( P < 0.05).

The reduction of NO3– to NO2– by NR, is the main and most limiting step, in addition to

being the most prone to regulation (Sivasankar et al., 1997; Ruiz et al., 1999). The synthesis of this enzyme is induced by nitrate (Oaks, 1994), but although its activity is known to be repressed by ambient ammonium, there are evidences that this enzyme can be regulated by

certain amino acids. The results for the possible regulation of NR activity by amino acids for higher plants are contradictory. Many authors agree with that amino acids can inhibit the activity of NR in higher plants (Radin, 1975, 1977; Oaks et al., 1979; Ivashikian and Sokolov, 1997; Sivasankar et al., 1997; Aslam et al., 2001). But Aslam et al. (2001) reported that inhibition did not occur when the concentration of NO3– in the external solutions had been increased to 10 mM. This result is consistent with the other research, which indicates that radish treated with mixed amino acids containing 5.0 mM NO3– in growth medium showed

significant increase of NR activity (Liu et al., 2005). The effect of amino acids on NR activity seems to be depended on plant materials, age of plants, growth conditions, nitrate

concentration, kinds of amino acids, amino acids concentration and other factors. In this experiment, the positive effect on NR activity by applying AAF was due to high NO3–

content in soil.

In the present experiment, the treatments of AAF led to different levels of increase of NR

activity and inhibition on GS activity depending on applied rates. The high activities of three enzymes were found in A1 due to the positive effect of AAF on process of NO3–

assimilation. However, inhibition on NiR and GS was observed in A2 and A3 for the reason

that high rates of AAF application had high feed–back inhibition on NO3– reduction systems which affected GS first. This is probably the main reason why different effects on the

enzymes were observed in this study.

6.2.2 Effect of AAF on biomass and utilization of N and P

The plant biomass production in fresh weight was found to be significantly higher ( P < 0.01) in the AAF treatments (mean biomass in fresh weight of A1, A2 and A3 are 5.056, 4.738 and 4.653 Kg m–2, respectively) compared with the control (mean biomass in fresh weight is

4.026 Kg m–2) (Table 18). Among AAF treatments, the treatment with low concentration of

AAF (A1) had a higher ( P > 0.05) biomass production than the treatment with high concentration of AAF (A3). The response of biomass production in dry weight to AAF

treatments resembled that in fresh weight (Table 28), with significant influence by applying AAF ( P < 0.01). The highest biomass production in dry weight was found in A1, with an increase of 17% in relation to A0.

The result of N utilization (Table 18) was similar to biomass production as described above, again registering the highest value in A1 (14.48 ± 0.89 g m–2), with an increase of 55%

compared with A0 (9.33 ± 0.87 g m–2) ( P < 0.01). Furthermore, significant effects were observed in A2 and A3 too, with increases of 40% and 37% respectively, in relation to A0 ( P < 0.01). Even though P content was not influenced by the application of AAF (Table 20), P utilization

increased in AAF treatments due to the increase of biomass production (Table 18).

The observed result of vegetation cover and calculated values of net N uptake are showed in Table 19. The treatments of AAF showed higher vegetation cover than the control. Besides

the N input by applying of AAF, the treatments of AAF showed significant increase of

36~55%net N uptake compared with the control. Gunes et al. (1996) suggested that plants

probably preferred amino acids as sources of reduced nitrogen, but they did not distinguish origin of the N contents in the plants. In our experiment, the increase of N uptake is about 200 times (Table 19) more than N supplied by applying AAF, indicating application of AAF

could enhance the ability of uptake and assimilation of inorganic N by plants.

Agricultural Science

These results are in agreement with those observed by Chen et al. (1997), who reported that application of amino acids led to positive effects on cabbage growth. However, among the

treatments of AAF, the growth responses were decreased by increasing the application rate of AAF. This may probably be related to the feed–back inhibition of high rate application of amino acids.

6.2.3 Effect of AAF on contents of N and P

The data in Table 20 showed that N contents of the plants were affected by using amino acid fertilizer. The NO3– content of radish was decreased by application of AAF ( P < 0.05) compared with the reference treatment. Among the treatments, A1 gave the best result in

reducing the nitrate to 1.16 mg g–1 (FW), with a decrease of 24% in relation to the highest NO3– content found in A0. This result agrees with the interpretation that amino acid can

negatively regulate nitrate content in higher plants (Gunes et al., 1994, 1996; Chen and Gao, 2002; Wang et al., 2004). But this interpretation was not supported in all cases. It was

observed that the mixed amino acids increased NO3– content slightly in radish when the

plants growing in nutrient solution. The contradiction may reside in amino acids treatment method. It was demonstrated in other studies that amino acid pretreatment decreased NO3–

accumulation slightly, but Gln and Asn led to NO3– concentration increase in barley roots when they were used together with nitrate (Aslam et al., 2001).

With respect to the main products of NO3– assimilation, amino acids and proteins (Table 20), the plants in treatment A1 gave the highest contents of these compounds ( P < 0.01). In the A1 treatment, high activities of main enzymes of NO3– assimilation could explain the

predominance of these nitrogenous compounds in radish. Under treatments of A2 and A3,

the increases of amino acids and proteins derived from the direct uptake of amino acids

from AAF.

The total N content of the plants was also affected significantly by the use of AAF ( P < 0.01).

Treatments of A1, A2 and A3 showed to increase the total N to 32%, 21% and 15% relative to the control, respectively. These increases were due to the positive adjusting of AAF on uptake and assimilation of N, and attributing to the increases of N utilization and net N uptake. The P

content of radish was not affected significantly by the application of AAF (Table 20).

6.2.4 Effect of AAF on chemical properties of soil

The chemical properties of soil in middle growth period and at the end of experiment were showed in Table 21 and Table 22. The planting of radish affected total N of soil clearly, except at 35 days after sowing, with a fall of 10% compared with non planting treatment.

However, there were no differences in total N of soil among treatments planted with radish.

On the other hand, either planting treatment or AAF treatment showed effect on nitrate in soil.

In the soil of non planting, nitrate was decreased by leaching and runoff by rain. Compared with the non planting treatment, the treatments of planting showed 20~30% decrease at 25

days after sowing and 23~42% decrease at 35 days after sowing in the nitrate content of soil.

Although with the lowest net N uptake, the lowest concentration of nitrate in soil was found in A0 treatment both at two sampling times. This was due to the fact that the vegetation

covers of AAF treatments were higher than treatment of A0, and could effectively prevent

nitrate of soil from leaching or runoff. The planting treatments showed lower values of EC

than non planting treatment, but all were in the range of general soil. There were no

significant differences among all treatments in pH and organic matter of soil. Moreover,

very small differences were observed in available P due to different growth rate of the

plants.

Table 23. Effect of amino acid fertilizer on nitrate removal from the soil

The data of NO3– removal are showed in Table 23. Even though the highest NO3– removal

was found in treatment A0, the most removed NO3– was leached (73.7%) and would lead to

pollution for groundwater. The application of AAF can enhance NO3– removal rate by

planting, and avoid N losses through leaching and runoff due to increases of N utilization (Table 18) and vegetation cover (Table 19).

In conclusion, the results of the present experiment suggest that application of amino acid fertilizer can affect activities of three enzymes of N assimilation (NR, NiR and GS) and

increase the growth and N assimilation in radish. However, the exact reason for this

observation is not known and requires further investigation. The planting of radish proves very effective for nitrate removal in soil by its fast growth and very high biomass

production (345.7~404.4 g DW m–2) and N utilization (9.33~14.48 g m–2) in short time (only 35 days in our experiment). Furthermore, the application of amino acid fertilizer can

enhance biomass production, N utilization, and concentrations of proteins and amino acids, and it can reduce N losses through leaching and runoff.

7. Conclusions

By conducting these experiments, several findings were obtained: (1) increase of NO3–

uptake by application of MAA, (2) different effect of MAA dictated by N status, (3) efficient NO3– removal by application of AAF, and (4) true role of MAA in process of NO3– uptake

and assimilation.

Both for radish and red pepper, the application of MAA led to significant increase of NO3–

uptake and activities of the three enzymes (NR, NiR and GS) of the NO3− assimilatory

pathway in solution experiment. These results are different from other researches which

inhibition was observed in most case. This difference was caused by two main reasons: (1) that effect of MAA was different to single amino acid, and (2) comparative high level NO3−

was supplied in these experiments.

In pot experiments, responses to applied MAA were affected by plant species and NO3–

level in soil. For radish, application of MAA led to increases of activities of three enzymes, growth, N utilization, and concentrations of proteins, and decrease of NO3– content in

plant shoots, when the plants were planted in high NO3– soil. However, in the case that

radish was planted in low NO3– soil, activities of the enzymes were decreased by using

MAA, and growth, and concentrations of proteins, amino acids, total N and NO3– content

were not affected. These phenomena indicate that the effect of MAA is dependent on

NO3– level.



Effect of Mixed Amino Acids on Crop Growth

151

With respect to red pepper which was planted in high NO3– soil, foliar MAA sprays

increased activities of the three enzymes, while reduced NO3– content, concentrations of

proteins and amino acids, total N and N utilization. Partially different results were found in red pepper which was planted in low NO3– soil, including decreased activities of NiR and

GS and increased of NO3– content in plant shoots by the application of MAA. The reason for these differences is the same to that of radish.

In field experiment of radish, the foliar sprays of AAF increased NO3– removal rate by

planting, and avoid N losses through leaching and runoff due to increases of N utilization and vegetation cover. In addition, the application of AAF enhanced activities of three enzymes, biomass production, and concentrations of proteins and amino acids, reduced NO3– content in plant shoots. Similarly, for red pepper, the use of AAF led to increase of N utilization.

However, decrease of total N content in red pepper plants was found in AAF treatments.

These results of 15N labeled experiments and field experiments suggest that the main role of amino acids on nitrate uptake and assimilation might be relation with the regulation of NO3–

uptake and assimilation, but not as sources of reduced nitrogen. In pot experiments, it was indicated that the N utilization of plants was depended on soil NO3– uptake which was

regulated by application of MAA. In field experiment of radish, the increase of N utilization is about 200 times more than N supplied by applying AAF, indicating application of AAF

could enhance the ability of uptake and assimilation of inorganic N by plants.

Finally, the effect of amino acids on NO3– uptake and assimilation was also influenced by stage of plant growth. For leaf radish, response of enzymes activity and yield was not affected by the stage of growth, while N accumulation (total N content) was more sensitive to applied amino acids in vegetative stage than that of young stage. With regard to red pepper, effects of amino acids on enzymes activity and N content in different growth stage were quite similar, while growth (dry biomass) showed to be increased significantly in vegetative stage.

A better understanding of effect of amino acid on process of NO3– uptake and assimilation will undoubtedly help in developing an approach to improve the management of fertilizer

nitrogen and to prevent N loss through leaching or runoff. In the further study, more

detailed researches should be carried out to investigate the precise manner by which MAA

influences NO3– uptake and assimilation. The researches will focus on the effect of MAA on NR gene expression and relation between GDH and GS.

Plant Temperature for Sterile Alteration of Rice

1. Introduction

Temperature affects not only the growth rate, but also reproductive development of rice.

When temperature was higher than a critical point value during 5-15 days before heading,

rice thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line showed pollen sterility. Otherwise, it would be fertile (Lu et al 2001). The relationship between temperature and plant growth or reproductive development is usually studied by using a thermometer screen at a weather

station placed at height of 150 cm (TA), although a few studies were also performed to

describe more direct and accurate effects of micro-climate temperature at rice canopy on

plant growth and reproductive development.

Plant temperature (Tp) is regulated by various factors including solar radiation, cloud cover, wind speed, soil heat flux, and transpiration of plant. Besides, temperature and flow

velocity of irrigated water have significant effects on rice Tp. Many methods and simulations on Tp have been reported (Cellier 1993, Cui et al 1989, Ferchinger 1998, Hasegawa 1978, Leuning 1988a, 1988b, Lu et al 1998, Tetsuya et al 1982, Van et al 1989, Wei et al 1981, Zhao et al 1996). Tp was used as the index of water supply regime for wheat or corn (Cheng et al 2000, Huang et al 1998, Shi et al 1997, Yuan et al 2000), freezing injury or grain filling rate of wheat (Feng et al 2000, Li et al 1999, Liu et al 1992, Xiang et al 1998, Xu et al 2000). In recent studies, it was found that the fertility alteration of rice TGMS line was sensitive to Tp (Lu et al 2007, Xu et al 1996). Lu et al (2004, 2007) found that the sterility of TGMS was simulated more accurately by temperature at stem part of 20 cm height or air temperature (Ta) around the part when compared with TA at a weather station (Lu et al 2004, 2007, Zou et al 2005). So far, little is known about how Tp is regulated by microclimate or irrigated water (Hu et al 2006).

2. Plant temperature and its simulation model of thermo-sensitive male

sterile rice

The present chapter was performed to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of Tp and its relationships with microclimate of canopy and irrigated water by using a TGMS line under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions. Two models were established to understand

how Tp is regulated by environments.

A TGMS rice line, Peiai64S, was used as plant material. Flowing irrigated water depth of 10-15 cm was treated, and no irrigated (keeping humid) was treated as control.

Tp and microclimatic factors were determined as below:

Agricultural Science

Tp: PTWD-2A sensors were inserted in stem sheaths at heights of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm and 40

cm, respectively, to measure Tp.

Air, water and soil temperatures: PTWD-2A sensors were placed at 10 cm and 5 cm under

the ground, and 5 cm, 20 cm, 40 cm, 60 cm, 100 cm, 150 cm above the ground, respectively, to measure temperatures of soil, water and air.

Wind speed: EC-9S sensors were used to measure wind speed at height of 150 cm.

All above data were obtained using TRM-ZS1, automatically collecting every 10 seconds

and storing every 10 minutes.

When 50% of flag leaves appeared perfectly, five plants were sampled and dissected at

height of each 10 cm to determine layered LAI. Layered LAI was determined with

traditional method, i.e., calculated according to the dry matter of harvested layer and the specific leaf area of each layer from sampled leaves (SLA).

2.1 Change of rice Tp

2.1.1 Daily change of Tp

Fig. 1 showed the daily changes of air temperature at height of 150 cm (TA) and Tp at

heights of 20 cm and 40 cm (Tp20 and Tp40) under non-irrigated condition. The data were

collected from random 30 days, during which 11 d were sunshine, 9 d were cloudy, and

10 d were overcast. Tp showed different value from TA, although they had a similar trend

in daily change. TA and Tp could be simulated by using same parameters and a similar

equation.

Calculated the data of Fig. 1, result showed that, during 08:00-20:00, Tp was significantly lower than TA. Tp20 was lower than TA by an average of 1.44°C and the largest margin of

2.3°C, while Tp40 was lower than TA by an average of 1.25°C and the largest margin of 2.1°C.

During 21:00-07:00, Tp20 and Tp40 were lower than TA only by 0.27°C and 0.06°C,

respectively.

Fig. 1 and its simulation equations (1), (2), (3) showed that, during daytime (06:00-18:00), the variation of both Tp and TA fit the sinusoid curve, but the coefficient showed TA＞Tp40＞Tp20.

During night time (18:00-06:00), the variation of both Tp and TA fit the exponent curve, but the coefficient showed TA＞Tp40≈Tp20. The simulation equations and their effects were

described as follows：

Differences (visual temperature difference from thermometer, >0.2°C) were detected in

value and time between the maximum Tp and the maximum TA. The daily maximum value

was 26.1°C for Tp20, and 26.5°C for Tp40, whereas the maximum value was 27.5°C for TA. The maximum value of Tp occurred at 13:00, 1 h earlier than that of TA. Their minimum values, however, both appeared at 06:00. The fluctuation in daily change also showed significant

difference: TA (6.8°C)＞Tp40 (5.8°C)＞Tp20 (5.3°C).

2.1.2 Difference of Tp at vertical height

Fig. 2 showed Tp and Ta at different heights observed at 06:00 and 13:00 under non-irrigated condition (30 d, same as Fig.1). Although the differences between Tp and Ta were not

significant, Tp at 13:00 at heights of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm were all higher than Ta at corresponding heights without exception. Tp40 and Tp20 were higher by 0.24°C and 0.60°C,

respectively. The decreased rate of Tp (0.1°C /10 cm) was lower than that of Ta (0.41°C /10

cm). At 06:00, Tp at 30-40 cm was higher than Ta, whereas it showed an opposite difference at 10-20 cm.

2.2 Effects of environmental factors on Tp

Solar radiation and irrigated water were two main heat sources affecting rice Tp. Cloud

cover, wind speed and LAI of canopy also affect Tp by regulating heat transmission or

radiation intensity. Temperature and flowing speed of irrigated water were two main

factors regulating Tp.

2.3 Effects of Ta on Tp

2.3.1 Change of Ta and its effects on Tp

Fig. 3 showed daily changes of Tp and Ta at heights of 20 cm and 40 cm under sunshine (11

d) and cloudy (10 d) days. During 06:00-13:00 in sunshine days, Tp was increased earlier

than Ta by 1 h, and Tp was maximized at 13:00 (28.1°C for Tp20, and 28.7°C for Tp40). In

contrast, Ta was increased later than Tp by 1 h, and Ta was maximized at 14:00 (27.4°C for Ta20, and 28.5°C for Ta40). Besides, the raising intensity was Tp stronger than Ta by 0.7°C (20

cm) and 0.2°C (40 cm). Tp showed close to or even little lower than Ta during night time

(18:00-06:00). The significant difference between Ta and Tp during daytime might be caused by the larger absorption of solar radiation by plant than air. When the heat was absorbed, the plant released its energy in long wave, which resulted in an increase of Ta around the plant. After 13:00, along with the diminishing of solar radiation, Tp began to decrease but Ta was reacted dully (decreased one or two hours later under sunny days). Under cloudy days, Tp was higher than Ta all the day. At heights of 20 cm and 40 cm, Tp was 0.4°C higher on

average, and the maximum one by 0.5°C for Tp20 and 0.4°C for Tp40, and the minimum one

by 0.3°C for Tp20 and 0.4°C for Tp40, respectively. This suggested that there was a weak

exchange between plant and air on cloudy days.

2.3.2 Statistical relation of Tp to TA

In the present chapter, Tp at 20 cm and 40 cm, and TA at 150 cm observed at 06:00 and 13:00

were used to establish linear regression equations. Results showed that the regression

coefficient of Tp40 was lower than that of Tp20, confirming that solar radiation was the key resource of heat in plant.

2.4 Effect of wind speed

Fig. 4 showed the relationship between Tp20 and wind speed at 150 cm (V). The equation

was: Tp20 = -14.411 V +32.622 ( R2=0.334*, n=39). The result indicated that wind speed on the top of canopy had a significant effect on Tp.



Fig. 4. Relationship between plant temperature at 20 cm and wind speed at 150 cm.

2.5 Effects of irrigated water

Irrigated water was another important effect regulating rice Tp. Water temperature (Tw) and Ta were varying in different manners, which resulted in a remarkable difference in their

effects on Tp.

2.5.1 Temporal change of effects of irrigated water on Tp

Fig. 5 showed daily varying curves of Tp (30 d) at 20 cm and 40 cm of plants grown with

and without irrigated water. The average temperature of inflow water was 26.9°C (21.5-

34.0°C), and TA was 23.7°C (13.5-36.5°C). Irrigated water increased Tp at 20 cm and 40 cm by 0.7°C and 0.5°C, respectively, or by 0.35°C and 0.25°C, respectively, for per 1°C of

water-air temperature margin. The effect of increased Tp by irrigated water was higher at night than at daytime. Tp20 was increased by 1.01°C during 19:00-05:00, and by 0.37°C

during 06:00-18:00, but decreased by 0.19°C during 11:00-14:00. At 40 cm, Tp40 was

increased by 0.77°C during 19:00-05:00, and by 0.20°C during 06:00-18:00, but decreased

by 0.25°C during 11:00-13:00. The results showed that irrigated water had more significant effects on Tp during night than daytime. In daytime, solar radiation partly withstood the effects of water irrigated. At the noon when solar radiation was the maximum, irrigated

water decreased Tp.

2.5.2 Effects of irrigated water on Tp at vertical height

Tp (30 d, same as Fig. 1) at four heights at 06:00 and 13:00 was compared between irrigated and non-irrigated conditions (Table 1). The effect of irrigated water on Tp was decreased lower along with the increase of height. It was a difference by 2.5°C at 10 cm, 0.6°C at 20 cm, 0.5°C at 30 cm, and 0.4°C at 40 cm. At 06:00, irrigated water could increase Tp (increasing rate of 3.7°C

at 10 cm), but the increasing rate was lowered along with the increasing of plant height.

Around noon, Tp showed 0.7°C increase at 10 cm but a decrease at 20-40 cm. The effect of

irrigated water on Tp was stronger at the lower site than at the higher site in plants.

on the weather record (TA from 17.4-30.5°C with the average of 23.7±8.6°C, Tw from 22.2-

31.9°C with the average of 26.9±6.7°C). It implied that, when TA=29.6°C, then Tw-

A=0°C；when TA＞29.6°C, Tw-A was lower than TA, irrigated water decreased Tp.

Conversely, when TA＜29.6°C, irrigated water increased Tp. When TA decreased from

29.6°C, Tw-A would be decreased in power. When TA decreased from 27.4°C to 22.0°C

(decreased by 5.4°C), Tw-A was enlarged from 2°C to 4°C. When TA decreased from 16.5°C to 12.9°C (decreased only by 3.6°C), Tw-A was enlarged from 6°C to 8°C. Obviously, the regulatory effect would be enlarged under a lower TA.

Fig. 6 showed the relationship in Tp difference (at 20 cm and 40 cm) between irrigated and non-irrigated (ΔTp) and the difference between water-air temperature (Tw-A, average value of 720 samples) (equation 4 and 5). The results showed that, in a range of (-5.45°C)–

(+10.32°C) for Tw-A, ΔTp and Tw-A showed a significant conic relationship. When Tw-A= -5°C, ΔTp at 20 cm and 40 cm was -1.10°C and -0.71°C, respectively. When Tw-A=5°C , ΔTp at 20 cm and 40 cm was 0.84°C and 0.66°C, respectively. When Tw-A=10°C, ΔTp at 20 cm and 40 cm

was 1.42°C and 1.26°C, respectively.

2.5.4 Effects of flowing speed of irrigated water on Tp

Flowing speed of irrigated water was also an important factor affecting Tp. The margin of Tw between inflow and outflow (50 m between them) denotes the flowing speed of irrigated

water. The equation of Tp established by margin of Tw between inflow and outflow of 13

days (with TA=17.4-22.5°C) showed that Tp was affected significantly by flowing speed of

irrigated water (Fig.7).

2.6 Effects of LAI of canopy on Tp

Rice layered LAI was decreased along with the increase of plant height. The relationship

between Tp at 06:00 and 13:00 and their corresponding LAI at 5 heights was shown in Fig. 8.

At 13:00, Tp was increased (actual value was increased from 26.9°C to 28.4°C) along with the decrease of the accumulated LAI. At 06:00, Tp was decreased (actual value was decreased

from 20.6°C to 19.7°C) along with the decrease of the accumulated LAI. It indicated that the canopy absorbed solar radiation at daytime and released the heat energy during night,

which regulated Tp.

present study: average temperature of inflow and outflow water [(Tin+Tout)/2],

temperature margin between inflow water and air at 150 cm (Tin-TA), wind speed at 150

cm (V), and sunshine hours (S). Results showed that both of two equations showed

significant high R2 (equations 6 and 7 and Fig. 9). Among the five parameters, Tin and Tout can be obtained by an actual measure, and TA, V and S can be obtained from local weather

station.

2.8 Function for rice plant temperature

It could be traced root as early as 1960's when field microclimate regulated by irrigated water was researched. The detailed procedure, however, was not described until two-line

hybrid rice was applied (Xiao et al 2000, Zhou et al 1993). The sterility of rice TGMS line was controlled by temperature. A credible alteration point in temperature was important

not only for selection and identification of TGMS lines, but for monitoring sterility

alteration, determining effective methods to keep sterility of such TGMS, and increasing

seed production of two-line hybrid rice (Lu et al 2004, 2007). In the practice of past two decades, techniques commonly used temperatures from thermometer-screen which was

located in a 25×25 m2 green plot and 150 cm height in local weather station (TA). The

sensitive part of rice plant to temperature, however, was in its canopy (Lu et al 2004, 2007, Zou et al 2005). We have noticed that the sterility of rice TGMS lines was affected directly by Tp rather than TA. Therefore, it would be more accurate to monitor sterility of TGMS by using Tp in sensitive organs (Lu et al 2007). Tp was the final consequence of various environmental factors including air, water, soil, and the heat exchange among them.

When attacked by low temperature during sensitive stage, how does the plant response,

and how are agronomical methods used for safeguarding the sterility of rice TGMS? Such

issues should be addressed by further studies. It will be too late to guarantee seed





172

Agricultural Science

production of TGMS rice if only traditional methods are used. Simulation models of rice

Tp established in this chapter and its regulation by environmental factors such as by

inflow and outflow temperature of irrigated water, and TA, wind speed, sunshine hours

from local weather station have provided a more effective method for seed production of

two-line hybrid rice.

3. Plant temperature for sterile alteration of a thermo-sensitive genic male

sterile rice, Peiai64S

Rice thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line showed their sterile alteration along with the temperature change. An exact parameter to indicate sterile alteration was useful not only for breeding and identification of such TGMS, but was also helpful to determine

and estimate the sterility security of TGMS, and select suitable methods for safeguarding the sterility of TGMS in two line hybrid rice seed production. Up to date, the forecast of TGMS sterile alteration was only based on the daily average temperature determined by

local weather station (screen temperature at a height of 150 cm in a 25 m × 25 m green

plot), and used three days average temperature as the alteration point temperature (from

sterility transformed to partial fertility, seed setting rate from zero increased to 0.5%) (Lu et al 2001, Yao et al 1995). For instance, a TGMS, Peiai64S, set its alteration point temperature to be 23.5-24°C for average temperature with three days duration. When the

three days average temperature was higher than the point, Peiai64S will exhibit sterile,

otherwise partial fertility (Liao et al 2000, Lu et al 1999, Zou et al 2003). However, rice production practices showed that such parameter revealed its shortages in the following

points: I: Temperature forecasted by a weather station was the same value within a county (or a city), and it could not express the difference of microclimate of individual field.

Furthermore, the ground of screen in the weather station was different from rice field. It would cause the difference of temperature (Xie et al 2001). II: The sensitive part of rice to the environment condition was lower than the height of screen (Xu et al 1996), which would cause the difference of temperature as well. III: It was confirmed that when TGMS

was attacked by lower temperature weather, it was useful of water irrigated to increase

field or plant temperature for maintaining its sterility (Lu et al 2004, Xiao et al 1997, 2000, Zou et al 2005). However, it is difficult to estimate the increased degree of temperature by such forecasted screen temperature. IV: Seed production practices of two-line hybrid rice showed that under the same lower temperature weather, individual field exhibited

diversified seed purity for the differences of microclimate. It is inaccurate to estimate fertility by screen temperature. V: The alteration point temperature for fertility used only the upper point temperature (seed setting rate from zero to 0.5%) and no scale for lower

and optimum points. Also, there is no research report for such item so far. The author

consider that the fertility of TGMS was affected by plant temperature, which was caused

by all environmental conditions including air, water, soil, wind and so on. During the

fertility sensitive period, for rice TGMS of each seed production field, the damaged

degree, and the effect of measures against lower temperature must be estimated

immediately. If these are estimated only by the pollen fertility even seed set, it will be late for taking measures to avoid such damage of lower temperature. Thus, it is important to

establish an effective estimating and adjusting method for safeguarding seed production

of two-line hybrid rice.



Plant Temperature for Sterile Alteration of Rice

173

The temperature indices of sterile alteration must include two aspects as parameter of type and scale. The parameter type denoted the type of temperature (screen temperature of average or maximum or minimum one, otherwise as plant temperature of stem or leaf). The

temperature scale will include the upper point (seed setting rate from zero increased to 0.5%), the optimum (show highest seed setting rate), and the lower point (seed setting rate returned to zero again) of temperature, which were considered as the three basic temperature points.

The present chapter was aimed to establish such three basic temperature points.

A lower thermo-sensitive genic male sterile line, Peiai64S, which was widely used in two-

line hybrid rice breeding, was chosen as plant material. During the fertility-sensitive

period of all treatments, the microclimate and plant temperature were regulated by

irrigated water. Three irrigated depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, and 15 cm, each of these with

flowing and staying-water were used. Flowing irrigated water of 15 cm depth was also

treated. During the fertility sensitive stage, the stem temperature at plant height of 20 cm was measured continually per 10 s with an improved needle thermocouple sensor under

various types of weather. At the fertility sensitive stage, the plant and panicle height were determined, and furthermore the distance between the last two leaves. For all the sowing

date treatments, their self-fertilized seed setting rate was measured by 30 paper bag

insulated panicles.

3.1 Temperature differences between rice field and screen of weather station

Table 3 shows the temperature differences between the screen of weather station and rice

field at heights of 150 cm, 100 cm, 60 cm, 40 cm, and 20 cm. The four periods in Table 3 are: I: from 20 August to 29 September in 2004 and from 9 August to 30 September in 2005.

II: the earliest lower temperature days, 3 to 5 September in 2004. III: the earliest lower temperature days, 18 to 20 August in 2005. IV: the highest temperature day of 16 August,

2005. Table 3 shows that under various weather conditions, the temperatures of rice field at each height were different from the screen one of the weather station.

Agricultural Science

Owing to the difference in the underlay surface and growing plant, the temperature at each canopy height was lower than that of the screen of weather station in the four periods. For the periodⅠ, which represented the various weather conditions, the air temperature at

height of 150 cm showed 0.69°C lower than the screen temperature of the weather station,

which was at the same height. At heights of 100 cm, 60 cm, 40 cm, and 20 cm, owing to the energy absorbing and reflecting, temperature difference was enlarged at the four heights.

The average temperature at heights of 100 cm, 60 cm, 40 cm, and 20 cm of periodⅠ was

significantly lower than screen one by 1.10°C, 0.83°C, 1.18°C, and 1.63°C, respectively. A tendency of larger difference along with the height increase was seen, and the largest one was seen at 20 cm.

3.2 Fertility sensitive position and its height

It was reported that developing panicle was the fertility sensitive part of rice (Xu et al 1996). Thus, panicle height was important for determining the fertility sensitive position and the water depth for irrigation to regulate the temperature of the fertility sensitive part. The preceding studies proved that the sensitive stage was around the stage of

meiosis of pollen mother cells (panicle developing stage IV – VI), and the visible

morphological trait was at ±5 cm distance between the last upper two leaves (DL) (Lu et al 2001). Fig. 10 shows the correlation between the panicle height, length, and the DL. Result showed that during the stage, panicle height from the base was 15.3-21.9 cm with an

average value of 18.5 cm, and meanwhile, the panicle length was 9.7-16.8 cm with an

average value of 13.2 cm when DL was ±5 cm. It indicated that height of 20 cm was the

suitable location for fertility sensitivity.

Table 4 shows the correlation coefficients between the self-fertilized seed setting rate and air temperature at various plant heights or screen one with a liner, conic, and present model (See the part ‘3.3 Model of fertility-temperature’). The result showed that the coefficients between the self-fertilized seed setting rate and stem or air temperature at 20 cm height were the highest and showed significant correlation.

It indicated that height of 20 cm was the location expressing the highest correlation

coefficient. The result happened to meet the height of panicle at that time. Thus, 20 cm was taken as the suitable location for expressing the fertility of TGMS.

3.3 Model of fertility-temperature

3.3.1 Fertility sensitive stage

Determining fertility sensitive stage was the base to establish a model of fertility-

temperature. The fertility sensitive stage can be determined by distance between the last upper two leaves or can be checked by the length of panicle. However, a method by growth

days was popular for its advantage in quantitative analysis (Lu et al 2001). The method was given a range of growing days and it will cause difficulty for calculating temperature

accumulation (Lu et al 2001), since it does not consider the growing difference owing to temperature. The chapter determined the initiative date (total days as well) by effective accumulated temperature >24. The method was set as：

3.3.2 Fertility-temperature model

By analyzing the relationship between the fertility and temperature, it was found that the fertility showed a rule of recovery-increase-decrease along with temperature decreasing.

Thus, the chapter set the base of the model as: when the temperature decreased to an

upper limit (self-fertilized seed setting rate of 0.5%), the TGMS was regarded as fertility, and at the optimum temperature, it showed the highest fertility. When the temperature





176

decreased furthermore to a lower limit, the self-fertilized seed setting rate returned to zero.

3.3.3 Analysis of temperature indices for sterile alteration by the model

Table 5 shows the simulation of stem or air temperatures with self-fertilized seed setting rate by three parameters as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, with three

durations of 1, 3, 5 days, and by 0.1°C of temperature step length for the simulation. Result showed that there were significant correlations between self-fertilized seed setting rate and the temperatures of 20 cm stem, air temperature or 150 cm air temperature with the three

temperatures and three durations. It also implied that the effect of average temperature was better than that of the maximum or minimum temperature, and three-day duration was

better than one-day or five-day durations. The result also showed that the stem and air

temperatures at 20 cm were better than 150 cm air temperature, and the stem temperature at 20 cm showed the best effect of simulation. Thus, stem temperature at 20 cm was selected as the best simulating parameter for the model.

Equations (9), (10), and (11) are the statistic models of the self-fertilized seed setting rate simulated with the actual self-fertilized seed setting rate and temperatures of 20 cm stem, air, and 150 cm air. With the self-fertilized seed setting rate of 0.5% as initial (upper limit) and that of zero as the lower limit, and with stem temperature at 20 cm for three days, using equation (9), upper limit temperature and lower limit temperature was determined to be

22.8°C and 21.7°C, respectively. When compared with air temperature at 150 cm, there was

1.2°C and 1.1°C lower, respectively. With air temperature at 20 cm for three days, using

equation (10), upper limit temperature and lower limit temperature was determined to be

23.2°C and 21.5°C, respectively. When compared with air temperature at 150 cm, there was

0.8°C and 1.3°C lower, respectively.

3.4 Stem and air temperatures at 20 cm

Considering energy exchange and balance, stem and air temperatures in rice canopy were

connected with two energy sources: solar radiant energy and water heat energy. To avoid

trouble in actual operation, the chapter established effective statistic models as equations (12) and (13), which included the screen temperature (TA), cloud cover (N, from 1 to 10), and the water temperature at inflow (Tin) and outflow (Tout). Only by determining Tin and Tout, stem or air temperature at 20 cm could be calculated by screen temperature and cloud cover, which were both offered by the local weather station. It was helpful to estimate the damage of lower temperature weather and the effects of the adjusting measures in actual seed

production.

3.5 Techniques by used plant temperature to safeguard sterile of Peiai64S

Peiai64S was a widely used TGMS in two-line hybrid rice breeding. Its fertility was

controlled by temperature during its sensitive stage. Its sterility usually fluctuated owing to the frequent fluctuation caused by monsoon, which resulted in damage to the seed purity of seed production in China southern rice area (Lu et al 2001, Yao et al 1995). The first so-called super hybrid rice in China, Liangyoupeijiu, which was released by the authors’ research

group, was popularized over 7 million ha, and has been the major planted rice for its largest planting area of China from 2002. However, in lower reaches of Yangtze River, in the past five years, there was twice lower temperature weather (daily averaged temperature for three days lower than 24°C) in August, during which was the sterility sensitive period of TGMS, that caused damage to the seed production of Liangyoupeijiu and other two-line hybrid rice.

It was a hidden problem for seed production of two-line hybrid rice. In the seed production practices of Liangyoupeijiu, it was found that when attacked by lower temperature weather, the seed purity exhibited a large difference even if the TGMS was in a same weather

condition, owing to the individual differences at landform and water treatment and so on.

Researches showed that the fertility of rice TGMS was affected directly by plant

temperature, which was infected by the microclimate of the field (Hu et al 2006). When attacked by lower temperature weather, by irrigating warmer water from river or deep pool, Plant Temperature for Sterile Alteration of Rice

179

plant temperature would be increased by 2°C, which was effective for safeguarding the

sterility of TGMS (Lu et al 2004, Zou et al 2005). So far, the forecast of sterile alteration is only based on the temperature information from weather station; there is lack of any study on

field microclimate or plant temperature, and especially no research has focused on the

temperature scale of plant or air around it. In researches of wheat, some researchers used plant temperature as the parameter for freeze injury and grain growing speed (Feng et al 2000, Liu et al 1992).

The chapter put forward a method to conclude the fertility of TGMS by stem or air

temperature at 20 cm height, which takes various factors including microclimate and

location of field into account. It is more direct and exact than the traditional method. In rice production, we can use it to estimate any field or representative plot of a large field, and to monitor directly the result of regulation for safeguarding seed production in two-line hybrid rice. The technique is: when attacked by lower temperature weather with average

temperature lower than 24°C during 5-15 days before TGMS heading, using infrared or

thermosensor temperature indicator to determine plant stem temperature at 20 cm height or air temperature around it at 02:00, 08:00, 14:00, 20:00 (or only 08:00 and 20:00) every day. If the averaged value is lower than the line of 22.8°C for stem temperature or air temperature is lower than 23.2°C, it implies that the TGMS will transform its sterility to fertility. For safeguarding its sterility, it is necessary to irrigate by warmer water higher than 25°C, and by depth of 15 cm, until the temperature is higher than the above index.

The present chapter also established a statistic model for stem or air temperature at 20 cm height. By the inflow and outflow water temperatures of any field, and screen temperature and cloud cover from the local weather station, stem or air temperature at 20 cm height can be concluded. For an application example, if one day, the average temperature and cloud

cover was 22°C and 9, respectively, and the actual water temperature of the field was 23°C, by (12) and (13), stem or air temperature at 20 cm height was calculated to be 22.55°C and 22.74°C, respectively, both of which were lower than the above temperature index. By

irrigating warmer water from river, the inflow and outflow water temperature were

measured as 26°C and 24°C, by (12) and (13), the stem and air temperature at 20 cm height was calculated to be 23.74°C and 24.23°C, respectively, since both are higher than the above temperature index, it will be effective for safeguarding the sterility of TGMS.

1. Introduction

Over the last several years, mycotoxins, which are metabolites secreted by fungi, have been the subject of numerous studies. These eukaryotes play a major ecological role in the life cycle of plants. Indeed, for some fungi, the role of saprophyte places them at the heart of ecosystem dynamics [Alexopoulous et al., 1996].

Some 350 mold species produce a large range of secondary metabolites (over 300, of which

~30 are toxic) [Fremy et al., 2009] and represent a potential danger for animal and human health and cause significant losses for the cereals industry [Le Bars et al., 1996]. The effects of mold are well illustrated by decreases in crop and livestock yields, public health

problems, or write-offs on the international cereal market [Le Bars, et al., 1996]. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates annual global losses from mycotoxins

at 1 billion tons of foodstuffs [Fao, 2001]. The primary organisms impacted by mycotoxins are plants. Currently, about 25% of agricultural crops worldwide are contaminated by these metabolites [Charmley et al., 2006].

In response to these significant economic and health risks, global non-tariff barriers (i.e., specific food-safety standards imposed on imported products) were erected to control

commercial trade based on the mycotoxic quality of foodstuffs. These measures generate

significant economic and material losses for countries that export contaminated foodstuffs, either because their cargo is refused or because of a reduction in prices. To limit these consequences, farmers and the food industry strive to reduce the presence of mycotoxins in their products. Therefore, producers and processors are searching for alternative analytical methods to determine, in a quick, simple, and inexpensive manner, the risk of their products containing fungi or mycotoxins. The use of infrared spectroscopy—a mature technology—to

monitor foodstuffs could respond to this need.

In this chapter, we focus on mycotoxins found mainly in wheat, barley, and corn and that

have been studied in the international literature; namely, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, and aflatoxin B1.

Agricultural Science

2. Advantages of using infrared spectroscopy to manage fungal and

mycotoxic risk for wheat, barley, and corn

Fungus can be detected by microbiological methods involving visual, microscopy, and

microbial-cultural methods.

Conventional methods of mold detection are based on direct observation by eye or by

microscope of thalli, contaminated foodstuffs, or microbial cultures. These methods are time consuming and require viable samples and a good deal of expertise. Counting methods are

difficult to apply to fungi because, during their reproduction, a spore generates a mycelium that can in turn divide itself into tens of individuals. Furthermore, a fungal contamination may not be visible at the surface of grains [Hirano, et al., 1998, Pearson, et al., 2001].

Other methods are based on molecular biology or on the detection of antigens specific to

given molds. Organisms, either dead or alive, can be detected by the polymerase chain

reaction (PCR) by copying a large number of DNA sequences that are originally present in

small quantities (with a multiplicative factor on the order of 109). By amplifying certain genes of toxigenic strains, PCR serves as a tool to determine the risk. Various researchers have tested PCR to detect Fusarium contamination in corn [Jurado et al., 2006; Jurado et al., 2005; Nicolaisen et al., 2009]. These methods are rapid, sensitive, and can be automated.

They are good qualitative methods (e.g., good selectivity) but offer only average precision in quantitative terms (they are called “semiquantitative”). These techniques are thus very

reliable, provided the fungal strain to be detected is known beforehand, and so are used as referential methods. With such methods, a grain is deemed of suitable microbiological

quality if less than 10 000 germs of the storage flora per gram of grain are detected.

New approaches are based on detecting constituents and fungal metabolites. Such approaches exploit the fact that molds have specific characteristics that distinguish them from other eukaryotes. These characteristics include the regulation of certain enzymes, the synthesis of lysine amino acid by a particular metabolic route, extremely structural characteristics (e.g., the Golgi apparatus), and genetic characteristics (e.g., haploid). From among these attributes, two types of compounds can be used as indicators of a fungal contamination.

The secreted compounds are synthesized compounds such as soluble carbohydrates (e.g.,

disaccharide trehalose and polyhydric alcohols such as mannitol or arabitol) or products of the metabolization of complex carbons such as volatile aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, spores, primary metabolites, secondary metabolites (i.e., volatile compounds). The last item gives rise to the characteristic fungal odor and is often detected by an electronic nose. For

nonvolatile compounds, other tools such as infrared spectroscopy seem better suited.

The structural compounds of mold can also be used for their detection. The main

polysaccharides of the cell wall of mold are the α et β (1-3) glucans, as well as chitin.

Ergosterol is a component of fungal cell membranes.

Chitin may absorb infrared light, making it useful for infrared spectroscopy [Nilsson, et al., 1994; Roberts et al., 1991]. The main inconvenience in using this component as an indicator of fungal contamination is that chitin is not limited to fungi; it is found in insects, diatoms, arachnids, nematodes, crustaceans, and several other living organisms [Muzzarelli, 1977]. In addition, it may take different forms, each of which requires a specific detection technique.

Roberts et al. [Roberts, et al., 1991] estimates the quantity of mold on barley by detecting this molecule but also detects glucans by near-infrared spectroscopy.

of Microorganisms and Their Metabolites on Cereals (Corn, Wheat, and Barley)

Ergosterol, however, is more specific to mold. This molecule, which may still be called

provitamin D2, is a C24-methylated sterol (and is part of the subgroup of organic

compounds that are soluble in lipids) and is found in the cell membranes of yeasts and

filamentous fungi. This molecule is not found in animal cells [Verscheure et al., 2002] and is in the minority among the sterols found in higher plants [Pitt et al., 1997] and insects [Weete, 1980]. Griffiths et al. [Griffiths et al., 2003] demonstrated that ergosterol is the primary sterol found in molds: it represents 95% of the total sterols, with the remaining 5% being

ergosterol precursors from Leptosphaeria maculans. This specificity makes this molecule a potential tracer of fungal activity. It is generally agreed that the ergosterol content of grains must be less than a given threshold; the limit for corn is 8 µg/g.

3. Infrared spectroscopy to detect fungal and mycotoxic contamination of

wheat, barley, and corn

3.1 Background and methods

The first application of infrared spectroscopy to detect microorganisms dates from the 1950s

[Miguel Gomez et al., 2003]. In these applications, the spectrometers were calibrated depending on the method of dosing the fungi or mycotoxins. In the 1980s, Fraenkel et al. [Fraenkel et al., 1980] and Davies et al. [Davies et al., 1987] published their first works on the detection by infrared spectroscopy of fungal contamination ( Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria tenuissima), but the application of this tool to detecting mold really grew in the 1990s. This growth was due to the fact the existing agronomic models required collecting a significant amount of data in the field, making this approach unsuitable for routine use. In addition, industry required nondestructive techniques to assess the health safety of crops. Therefore, several research teams used infrared spectroscopy to detect mold and mycotoxins on cereals, which could be done concomitantly

with the quantification of other parameters such as protein content, humidity, etc.

One method proposed to determine the fungal or mycotoxin content is to quantify the total fungal biomass. Toward this end, ergosterol is used as a fungus marker [Castro et al., 2002; Saxena et al., 2001; Seitz et al., 1977; Seitz et al., 1979]. Very often, this type of study is coupled with a study of the mycotoxin content and fungal units (colony-forming units or

CFU). Indeed, the quantity of fungi is not proportional to the quantity of mycotoxins; it is possible to have small quantities of fungi but large quantities of mycotoxins, and vice versa.

Indeed, fungi may disappear after secreting its toxins, either because of the evolution of the mycoflora or because of the application of chemical treatments. In addition, certain strains are more toxic than others. Two conclusions exist from the work on this subject: some

researchers find a correlation between the mycotoxin content, the ergosterol content, and/or the fungal units [Lamper et al., 2000; Le Bouquin et al., 2007; Miedaner et al., 2000; Seitz et al., 1977; Wanyoike et al., 2002; Zill et al., 1988] whereas the others find no correlation or cannot make categoric conclusions [Beyer et al., 2007; Diener et al., 1982; Gilbert et al., 2002; Nowicki 2007; Penteado Moretzsohn De Castro et al., 2002; Perkowski,et al., 1995].

Covering the last 20 years, we count over 20 articles dealing with the use of infrared

spectroscopy (primarily near-infrared) to detect molds and mycotoxins in wheat, barley, and corn. Because some of the work in infrared spectroscopy deals both with the detection and the identification of mycotoxins, we separate the articles into three groups. Table 1 is for molds, Table 2 compiles the trials dealing with deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins (FUMs),

and B1 aflatoxins (AF1). Finally, Table 3 contains articles in which the authors worked

simultaneously on the fungal and mycotoxic aspects. Each table lists the matrix studied

(wheat, barley, corn), the apparatus, the content ranges, the performance of the models, the principle conclusions, and the characteristic wavelengths.

3.2 Principal conclusions

3.2.1 Identification and quantification of fungi

For identification of fungi, the performances, given in terms of percentage of correct

classification, are very satisfactory because they exceed 77%. Each study identifies the peaks or spectral zones related to the growth of fungi or to the damage inflicted on the grains by fungi.

Moreover, the performance of the quantification of ergosterol always gives enticing

results.

3.2.2 Quantification of mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, and aflatoxins

Mycotoxins are present in quantities too small (in the order of parts per million) for direct detection. Their detection is thus associated with a complex ensemble of information related to the growth of the fungus on the cereal; notably with modifications of the protein or

carbohydrate level (starch, cellulose, etc.).

Regarding the capabilities of infrared spectroscopy to quantify mycotoxins, the conclusions differ from one author to another. In general, when dealing with deoxynivalenol, the

performance is higher than when dealing with fumonisins. Yet despite this, even if the

quantification of mycotoxins appears possible, it is not sufficiently precise to be used in the field. Indeed, the standard error of prediction (SEP) is too large with respect to the

regulatory limits—notably European limits. This could be explained by a magnification of

the non-negligible standard errors of the chemical benchmarks from which they are

developed. Moreover, to work under conditions of realistic of toxin levels, the main avenues for improvement of these studies may be the following:



Increasing the number of samples;



Increasing the annual variability (samples often come from a single harvest);



Allowing a natural contamination of the grains (artificial contamination does not

account for all the natural parameters of contamination, notably so for

multicontaminations);



Accepting a range of mycotoxin levels more adapted to the reality in the field (the

ranges are often very narrow);



Acquiring spectra not grain-by-grain, but from entire lots of grain. Indeed, it is more difficult to assign a global mycotoxin level to a lot, because the distribution of

mycotoxins is very heterogeneous, as is the case for the molds that synthesize the

mycotoxins;



Using a set of test samples (the proposed performances are often cross validated and

are thus better than they would be for an external test);



Displaying the ratio of standard error of prediction to sample standard deviation

(RPD).





192

Agricultural Science

Thus, instead of quantification, several studies propose a classification of cereals samples as a function of the mycotoxin level. This qualitative approach works better and, at least until the quantitative models are improved, seems the most conclusive for applications in realistic conditions. Note also that, even if the SECs (Standard Error of Calibration), SECVs

(Standard Error of Cross Validation), and SEPs (Standard Error of Prediction), are improved for the quantifications, these models are developed based on chemical benchmarks that

themselves have non-negligible standard errors.

4. Conclusion

Infrared spectroscopy offers multiple advantages. This tool requires no preparation and

does not use toxic products. It enables nondestructive analysis of the samples. Moreover, it is a rapid, low-cost technique that can be used online. The sample cell is resistant and

inexpensive (glass or quartz). Finally, infrared spectroscopy enables multiparametric

analyses and a large range of robust devices are available.

Models to classify cereals samples as a function of the type of fungus present or its level, or the presence of mycotoxins, represent an attractive tool to determine the fungal and

mycotoxic risk in the food industry; for example, in the field or in the silo. Regarding the quantification of mycotoxins, chemometrics, which is a field in constant progression, may one day deliver performances that meet agricultural and industrial needs.

1. Introduction

1.1 Importance of the crop and its cultivation

Pulses, the food legumes, have been grown by farmers since millennia providing

nutritionally balanced food to the people of India (Nene, 2006) and many other countries in the world. The major pulse crops that have been domesticated and are under cultivation

include black gram, chickpea, cowpea, faba bean, grass pea, green gram, horse gram, lablab bean, lentil, moth bean, pea and pigeon pea. The probable geographical origin of the more common pulses has been reported as:

A low input, short duration, high value crop, mung bean fits very well into rice-wheat

cropping systems and other crop rotations. It fixes nitrogen in the soil, requires less

irrigation than many crops to produce a good yield, and helps maintain soil fertility and texture. Including green gram to the cereal cropping system has the potential to increase farm income, improve human health and soil productivity, save irrigation water and

promote long term sustainability of agriculture (Chadda, 2010).

Agricultural Science

1.2 The plant

Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek [Synonyms: Phaseolus radiatus L. (1753), Phaseolus aureus Roxb.

(1832)], often known as green gram/mung bean, is native to India and Central Asia. It has been grown in these regions since prehistoric times (Vavilov, 1926) and as an important

legume crop in India throughout the year. The Sanskrit name for green gram is mudgaparni or mashaparni as per ancient Indian literature the Yajurveda (c. 7000 BC). While green gram cultivation spread over to many countries, especially in tropical and subtropical Asia, black gram ( Vigna mungo) cultivation has remained more or less confined to South Asia. The progenitor of these pulses is believed to be Vigna trilobata, which grows wild in India (Nene, 2006). The more common vernacular names include: mung bean, green gram, golden gram

(En). Haricot mungo, mungo, ambérique, haricot doré (Fr). Feijão mungo verde (Po).

Mchooko, mchoroko (Sw) (Mogotsi, 2006).

The genus Vigna comprises about 80 species and occurs throughout the tropics. Vigna radiata belongs to the subgenus Ceratotropis, a relatively homogenous and morphologically and taxonomically distinct group, primarily of Asian distribution. Other cultivated Asiatic Vigna species in this subgenus include Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Maréchal (moth bean), Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi & Ohashi (adzuki bean), Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper (black gram or urd bean), Vigna trilobata (L.) Verdc. (pillipesara) and Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi & Ohashi (rice bean). Hybrids have been obtained between many of these species. The species have often been confounded, especially Vigna radiata and Vigna mungo. The wild types of mung bean, which are usually smaller in all parts than cultivated types, are usually

classified into 2 botanical varieties: – var. sublobata (Roxb.) Verdc., occurring in India, Sri Lanka, South-East Asia, northern Australia (Queensland), in tropical Africa from Ghana to East Africa, southern Africa and Madagascar; – var. setulosa (Dalzell) Ohwi & Ohashi, with large, almost orbicular stipules and dense long hairs on the stem, and occurring in India, China, Japan and Indonesia. The cultivated types of mung bean are grouped as Vigna radiata var. radiata, although a classification into cultivar groups would be more appropriate. Two types of mung bean cultivars are usually distinguished, based mainly on seed colour: –

golden gram, with yellow seeds, low seed yield and pods shattering at maturity; often

grown for forage or green manure; – green gram, with bright green seeds, more prolific,

ripening more uniformly, less tendency for pods to shatter. Two additional types are

recognized in India, one with black seeds and one with brown seeds (Mogotsi, 2006).

1.3 Uses

Mature mung bean seeds or flour enter a variety of dishes such as soups, porridge, snacks, bread, noodles and even ice-cream. In Kenya mung bean is most commonly consumed as

whole seeds boiled with cereals such as maize or sorghum. Boiled whole seeds are also fried with meat or vegetables and eaten as a relish with thick maize porridge (‘ugali’) and

pancakes (‘chapatti’), whereas consumption of split seeds (dhal) is common among people

of Asian descent. In Ethiopia the seeds are used in sauces. In Malawi the seeds are cooked as a side dish, mostly after removing the seed coat by grinding. In India and Pakistan the dried seeds are consumed whole or after splitting into dhal. Split seeds are eaten fried and salted as a snack. The seeds may also be parched and ground into flour after removing the seed

coat; the flour is used in various Indian and Chinese dishes. The flour may be further

processed into highly valued starch noodles, bread, biscuits, vegetable cheese and extract for Insect Pests of Green Gram Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek and Their Management

the soap industry. Sprouted mung bean seeds are eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable; in

French they are erroneously called ‘ germes de soja’, in English ‘bean sprouts’. Immature pods and young leaves are eaten as a vegetable. Plant residues and cracked or weathered seeds

are fed to livestock. Mung bean is sometimes grown for fodder, green manure or as a cover crop. The seeds are said to be a traditional source of cures for paralysis, rheumatism,

coughs, fevers and liver ailments (Mogotsi, 2006).

1.4 Nutritional facts

Green gram is an important source of easily digestible high quality protein for vegetarians and sick persons. It contains 24 per cent protein, 0.326 per cent phosphorus, 0.0073 per

cent iron, 0.00039 per cent carotene, 0.0021 per cent of niacin and energy 334 cal/100g of green gram. The gap between realizable and actual yields needs to be bridged up with

appropriate technologies. The latter basically revolves around two aspects: production

and protection. Although the former has been a subject of greater emphasis at all levels of strategy, yet the latter continues to suffer from neglect and a sort of apathy under the

cover of ignorance, economic status of the farmers and many more factors. In India,

Acharya (1985) has pointed out that plant protection remains a most neglected aspect in

pulse cultivation; further stating that only 5 to 6 per cent of the growers use plant

protection measures in only 1.5 per cent of the total area under this crop. In view of the above facts, for the control of various pests in green gram, only certain insecticides have been recommended by several workers.

The composition of mature mung bean seeds per 100 g edible portion is: water 9.1 g, energy 1453 kJ (347 kcal), protein 23.9 g, fat 1.2 g, carbohydrate 62.6 g, dietary fibre 16.3 g, Ca 132

mg, Mg 189 mg, P 367 mg, Fe 6.7 mg, Zn 2.7 mg, vitamin A 114 IU, thiamin 0.62 mg,

riboflavin 0.23 mg, niacin 2.3 mg, vitamin B6 0.38 mg, folate 625 μg and ascorbic acid 4.8 mg.

The essential amino-acid composition per 100 g edible portion is: tryptophan 260 mg, lysine 1664 mg, methionine 286 mg, phenylalanine 1443 mg, threonine 782 mg, valine 1237 mg,

leucine 1847 mg and isoleucine 1008 mg. The starch consists of 28.8per cent amylose and

71.2per cent amylopectin. Mung bean seed is highly digestible and low in antinutritional

factors. It causes less flatulence than the seed of most other pulses, making it suitable for children and older people. Mung bean starch is considered to have a low glycaemic index,

i.e. to raise the blood sugar level slowly and steadily. The composition of sprouted mung bean seeds per 100 g edible portion is: water 90.4 g, energy 126 kJ (30 kcal), protein 3.0 g, fat 0.2 g, carbohydrate 5.9 g, dietary fibre 1.8 g, Ca 13 mg, Mg 21 mg, P 54 mg, Fe 0.9 mg, Zn 0.4

mg, vitamin A 21 IU, thiamin 0.08 mg, riboflavin 0.12 mg, niacin 0.75 mg, vitamin B6 0.09

mg, folate 61 μg and ascorbic acid 13.2 mg. The essential amino-acid composition per 100 g edible portion is: tryptophan 37 mg, lysine 166 mg, methionine 34 mg, phenylalanine 117

mg, threonine 78 mg, valine 130 mg, leucine 175 mg and isoleucine 132 mg. Sprouting

especially leads to an increased ascorbic acid concentration. Mung bean hay contains:

moisture 9.7 per cent, crude protein 9.8 per cent, fat 2.2 per cent, crude fibre 24.0 per cent, ash 7.7 per cent, N-free extract 46.6 per cent, digestible crude protein 7.4 per cent, total digestible nutrients 49.3per cent. Aqueous extracts of mung bean seeds have shown in-vivo hypotensive and hepatoprotective effects in rats. Extracts from mung bean seeds and husks have shown antioxidative effects.

1.5 Cultivation in Kenya

Green gram is a warm-season crop and grows mainly within a mean temperature range of

20–40°C, the optimum being 28–30°C; hence, can be grown in summer and monsoon

season/autumn in warm temperate and subtropical regions and at altitudes below 2000 m

in the tropics. It is sensitive to frost. It is mostly grown in regions with an average annual rainfall of 600–1000 mm, but it can do with less. It withstands drought well, by curtailing the period of flowering and maturation, but it is susceptible to water-logging. High humidity at maturity causes damage to seeds leading to seed discoloration or sprouting while still in the field. Green gram cultivars differ markedly in photoperiod sensitivity, but most genotypes show quantitative short-day responses, flower initiation being delayed by photoperiods

longer than 12–13 hours. The crop grows well in a wide range of soil types, but prefers well-drained loams or sandy loams with pH (5–) 5.5–7 (–8). Some cultivars are tolerant to

moderate alkaline and saline soils (Mogotsi, 2006).

Green gram is propagated by seed. There is no seed dormancy, but germination can be affected by a hard seed coat. Green gram seeds are broadcast or dibbled in hills or in

rows. Recommended sowing rates are 5–30 kg/ha for sole crops, and 3–4 kg/ha under

intercropping. Recommended spacing ranges within 25–100 cm × 5–30 cm; whereas, for

the more modern cultivars ripening in 60–75 days, maximum yields are obtained at plant

densities of 300,000–400,000 plants/ha. The later-maturing traditional cultivars generally need wider spacing. Recommended spacing for sole crop of green gram in Kenya are 45

cm between rows and 15 cm within the row, with a seed rate of 6–10 kg/ha and a sowing

depth of 4–5 cm. Mung bean can be grown mixed with other crops such as sugar cane,

maize, sorghum or tree crops in agroforestry systems. Short-duration mung bean is often

relay-cropped to make use of a short cropping period. In Kenya mung bean is usually

intercropped with maize, sorghum or millet; it is occasionally grown in pure stands or

intercropped with other pulses. The usual practice here is to place 1–2 rows of mung bean between rows of a cereal, or to plant mung bean in the cereal row. In pure stands, 1–2

weedings are necessary during the early stages of growth. In Kenya weeding is done

using hoes and machetes. Farmers do not normally apply any inorganic fertilizer to a

mung bean crop. Mung bean uses residues from fertilizer applications to the main crops

in the system, though it responds well to phosphorus. Nutrient removal per ton of seed

harvested (dry weight) is 40–42 kg N, 3–5 kg P, 12–14 kg K, 1–1.5 kg Ca, 1.5–2 kg S and

1.5–2 kg Mg. The nutrient removal is much higher when crop residues are removed to be

used for fodder. In its major area of cultivation, the monsoon tropics, mung bean is mainly grown as a rainy season crop on dryland or as a dry-season crop after the

monsoon in rice-based systems on wetland, making use of residual moisture or

supplementary irrigation. In some areas where adequate early rains occur, an early-season crop can be grown before the monsoon. In semi-arid regions of Kenya with 600–800 mm

rainfall evenly distributed over 2 rainy seasons, 2 mung bean crops are grown per year. In the Wei Wei Integrated Development Project in Sigor, Kenya, mung bean is grown under

irrigation. In India mung bean is often sown as a fallow crop on rice land as a green

manure (Mogotsi, 2006).

1.6 Cultivation in India

1.6.1 Historical background

India has been universally accepted as the original home of these two pulse crops. While

green gram was spread to many countries, especially in tropical and subtropical Asia, black gram has remained more or less confined to South Asia. Currently, green gram is being

grown in USA.

1.6.2 Area and production

India is reportedly the largest pulse growing country in the world both in terms of area as well as production covering 43.30 per cent of land area under pulses with 33.15 per cent

production. In another report, it has been described that India is the largest producer and consumer of pulses in the world accounting for 33 per cent of world’s area and 22 per cent of world’s production of pulses. Green gram is one of the most widely cultivated pulse

crops after chickpea and pigeonpea. The major producing states in India are Andhra

Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan accounting for about 70 per

cent of total production.

Reliable production statistics for mung bean are difficult to obtain, as its production is often lumped together with that of other Vigna and Phaseolus spp. India is the main producer, with an estimated production in the late 1990s of about 1.1 million t. China produced

891,000 t (19per cent of total pulse production in China) from 772,000 ha in 2000. No mung bean production statistics are available for Africa. China exported 110,000 t in 1998, 290,000 t in 1999 and 88,000 t in 2000. All mung bean produced in India is for domestic consumption.

In most parts of Africa where there are Asian communities, mung bean food products are

sold in the cities (Mogotsi, 2006).

In India it is cultivated in two seasons: kharif and summer. However, peak market arrivals are from September to October ( kharif) and June to July (summer). Green gram is mostly grown as a kharif crop (monsoon season) in the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh; but, in Tamil Nadu,

Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar it is grown as a summer crop. Green gram is a

short duration crop; the canopy closes in earlier than in cereal crops. Therefore, the critical period for crop-weed interference is limited to the first 30 days after sowing. However, the presence of weeds during this period may lead to 20 to 40 percent reduction in yield. The most phenomenal way of reducing weed infestation include preventive measures like use of

clean crop seed and pre-planting destruction of existing weeds by tillage. In the standing crop, one inter-row hoeing and weeding at 25 to 30 days after sowing is good enough to check potential losses. Sometimes in the monsoon crop, due to incessant rains, tillage

Agricultural Science

operations are not feasible; hence, the use of pre-plant incorporation of fluchloralin or pendimethalin at the rate of 0.75 to 1.0 kg per hectare is recommended.

1.6.3 Cropping systems

The common crop rotations followed in India include: green gram – mustard; green gram

– safflower; green gram – linseed; and green gram – wheat. In kharif, intercropping with maize, pearl millet, sesame, pigeon pea, and cotton is common. Spring or summer green

gram is grown as a catch crop. The crop sequences that have been successful are green

gram – maize – wheat, green gram – rice – wheat, green gram – maize – toria – wheat,

green gram – maize – potato – wheat. In spring planted sugarcane, it is also grown as an

intercrop. During rabi, it is grown in rice fallows of southern and south eastern region (ICAR, 2006).

i. Population of jassids (nymphs & adults) and white flies (adults) can be estimated by the visual count technique during early hours of the day from requisite plants per

replication (usually counting from 1/5th of total plant population per plot), selected at random and tagged. The top, middle and bottom parts of the tagged plants should be

given due consideration. Alternatively, the sudden trap method using a cubical iron-

frame trap of 45cm x 45cm base and 60cm height clothed in high density polythene

can be used to trap the adult jassids and whiteflies for easy counting. The nymphs can

be counted adopting the visual/sight-count technique from the plants by gently

turning the leaves. Similarly, for aphids, the nymphs and adults can be counted on

the plants directly taking observations from at least a 10cm top shoot/twig for

sampling. Yellow pan-traps or sticky traps can also be used for counting the jassids

and whiteflies.

The population of jassds and whiteflies can be estimated by the sudden trap method using a cubical iron-frame trap of 45cm x 45cm base and 60cm height clothed in high density

polythene or covered by muslin cloth on three sides, while one side and the top can be

clothed with high density polythene for viewing the adults captured in the trap. This is

possible when the crop is 35 to 40 day-old; thereafter, we have to rely on visual count

technique as it is not feasible to use the sudden trap because as per agronomical practices the spacing is recommended as 30cm between the rows and 10cm between two pants in a

row; though, we may go for a spacing of 45cm (row to row) by 15cm (plant to plant in a

row). Yes, an aspirator should be used to suck the adults for a reliable count. The few adults that might escape while counting from each tagged plant or replicate is a common error and will be taken care of if the sample size is more. The jassid nymphs move sideways but do

not leave the foliage while observing, hence their count is reliable.

Data from visual counts can be homogenized by following the square root transformation

method, especially when zero counts are recorded. We add 0.5 or 1.0 to the visual count

data and find the square root before analysis that has to be retransformed after analysis for interpretation. In case of percentage data, if the percentage values range between 30 and 80, usually arc sine (angular) transformation would not be required; however, if the percentage values happen to be less than 30 and/ or more than 80, then angular transformation is

required before analysis of data.

Green gram being an indeterminate plant, vegetative growth and flowering go together

when the plant is 35 to 40 days of age; hence, using a suction trap (battery operated/electric) might not be successful, as it will cause more harm to the plant and at the same time disturb the insects. We can use the suction trap if the field/plot size is large so that sampling can be taken from distant areas within the field being observed without disturbing the insect

species on adjacent plants.

ii. The associated natural enemies like syrphid flies, coccinellids and others, can be

recorded by the visual/sight count technique from the same number of plants per

replication (1/5th of total population) randomly tagged, during early hours of the

day. Observations can be taken to study the predator-prey function under caged

conditions.

iii. Observations can be taken on a weekly basis or a 10-day basis and the prevailing abiotic conditions of the atmosphere can also be recorded accordingly to work out the

correlation coefficients between the populations and the abiotic factors of the

environment.

It is true that correlations do not establish the cause and effect relationships and must be interpreted with caution. Therefore, further working out the simple regression lines or linear regressions through regression equations enables us to know the effect of the abiotic factors (independent variable) on the population (dependent variable). Data so collected and

collated over many years (at least for 5 years in succession) will give a good understanding of the population trend.

The equation of a line of regression (Y on X) is given as:

Y = a + bX





204

Agricultural Science

The data can be entered and processed in “MS-Excel” using the correlation function and

make a chart in excel using the custom type Classic Combination Chart (either line-column on two axes or lines on two axes) that also enables to have the regression equation and

coefficient of determination (R2).

iv. Estimation of the population density of insect pests and their natural enemies in the different treatments can be made and expressed as a percentage after comparing the

data from the control treatment or the standard check. Wherever applicable, diversity

indices can be computed using suitable techniques (Shanon-Weiner or Simpson

Diversity Index).

The following mathematical/ statistical analysis can be made towards estimating the species richness and diversity:

Mean density:

Where,

Where, p i = the decimal fraction of individuals belonging to ith species.

However, along with the Shanon Diversity Index the Simpson’s Index can also be

computed.

Simpson’s index is calculated using the equation:

N(N- 1)

Ds= 



n(n- 1)

N= Total number of individuals of all species

n= Number of individuals of a species

v. To record the incidence of blister beetles at flowering stage the numbers of beetles per plant for a fixed time interval during the morning hours (8 to 10am) or evening hours (3

to 5pm) of the day can be observed on the randomly tagged plants. However, some

species visit during early hours while others late; hence, a preliminary observation on

their behaviour shall become essential before standardizing the methodology for blister

beetle counts.

vi. To note the damage of pod borers, the numbers of healthy and damaged pods can be

counted from a known (pre-decided) sample of pods (say 100) taken from the tagged

plants and the data expressed as a percentage of the total. Usually the pods are split

open to record the species of the borer under study.

vii. For the estimation of the population of soil dwelling predators, especially carabids, pitfall traps (500ml capacity glass jars) should be laid out in each replication and at least 3 traps should be randomly placed in each plot of 18 sq. m. (6m X 3m as length X

breadth). For instant killing of the predatory insects and to avoid cannibalism (as in

carabid grubs), ethylene glycol or formalin (1-2%) can be used in the traps.

Comparisons among the treatments can be accounted for.

2.2 Loss estimation and establishment of economic threshold for the pod borer

In order to asses the losses caused by insect pests of green gram the paired plot experiment, as suggested by Leclerg (1971), can be adopted. The method involves growing the crop in 26

plots, each measuring preferably 6m X 3m. Each plot should be separated by a buffer strip of one meter all around. One set of plots has to be kept protected from insect infestation by regular need-based application of recommended insecticides. The other set of plots has to be exposed to natural infestation and thus called unprotected. Observations on the plant

height, number of primary branches, pod length, pod and grain damage (%), and any other

yield attributing parameter recorded from five randomly selected plants from each plot at maturity should be taken. Loss in yield can be calculated by comparing the yield obtained from protected and unprotected plots using the following formula:

X1 -X2

Loss in yield(%)=

×100

X1

Where

X1 = Yield in treated plot

X2 = Yield in untreated plot

The yield data can be analyzed statistically and significance tested using the "t" test.

2.3 Determination of economic threshold level for the lycaenid pod borer

In order to calculate the economic injury level for the pod borer, losses in grain weight due to various levels of larval density of the pod borer has to be estimated. Green gram can be sown in pots of suitable size and the neonate larvae can be released on the developing





206

Agricultural Science

tender pods or flowers at different population densities (1, 2, 3 and 4 larvae per plant or in a geometrical progression as 2, 4, 8 and 16). A no-larval release control should also be taken side by side on the pot plants. The plants should be caged properly and the treatments

replicated. Observations on the number of healthy and damaged pods, and grain weight per

plant should be recorded. Taking the reduction in yield due to different levels of larval density release, the regression analysis can be worked out to quantify the damage. The

economic injury level for the pod borer on green gram can be determined by using the

method suggested by Hammond and Pedigo (1982).

The economic threshold level can be calculated by the method suggested by Johnston and

Bishop (1987). They established economic threshold level as the population of economic

injury level minus the increase in population of the pest concerned per day. The increasing rate of larval population under natural field conditions can be determined by recording the weekly population of the pod borer during larval activity. The rate of increase in population can be calculated arithmetically.

2.4 Farmscaping in green gram with annual marigold and niger

Early flowering marigold variety must be sown in well prepared, raised nursery beds at

least 45 days before transplanting. Niger crop has to be directly sown 28 to 30 days before sowing the main crop of green gram. In short, sowing should be adjusted in such a manner

that flowering of niger/marigold and green gram should coincide so that nectar/pollen

feeding natural enemies would be attracted to the farmscape plants. The sowing operations for green gram and the different farmscape plants should be as:

1. In the green gram and niger farmscaping (3: 1 ratio), niger sowing is done first and

followed by sowing of green gram a month later.

2. In the green gram and marigold farmscaping (3: 1 ratio), transplanting of marigold on ridges should be carried out 45 days after sowing green gram.

The row to row distance and plant to plant spacing for green gram can be 60cm and 10cm,

respectively or 45cm and 10cm, respectively; whereas, mature seedlings of marigold are to be transplanted in between two rows of green gram at a distance of 30cm.

3. Pest management strategies

3.1 The pest insects

An estimated 200 insect pests that belong to 48 families in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Thysanoptera, and 7 mites of the order

Acarina are known to infest green gram and black gram. Under severe cases stem fly may

alone cause more than 90 per cent damage with a yield loss of 20 per cent (Talekar, 1990).

The galerucid beetle, Madurasia obscurella causes damage up to 20 – 60 per cent. Whitefly, a





Insect Pests of Green Gram Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek and Their Management

207

potential vector of mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV), can cause losses ranging from

30–70 per cent. The major insect pests, particularly those often cited, have been enlisted in Table - 1.

The insect pests that infest green gram are better classified according to their appearance based on crop phenology. Accordingly, they can be: (1) stem feeders, (2) foliage feeders, (3) pod feeders, and (4) pests of stored grains; which are also convenient to access their

economic importance so as to devise suitable management measures.

At the seedling stage are the agromyzid flies, also known as bean flies (possibly few

species), Melanagromyza ( Ophiomyia) phaseoli (Tryon) being of more common occurrence.

Ophiomyia phaseoli larva is a cortex feeder and pupates in the cortex mostly at the root-shoot junction. Sometimes pupae can be seen sticking under the membranous epidermis. In India

the girdle beetle, Oberiopsis brevis (Swedenbord), a major pest of soybean, sometimes infests mungbean locally (Talekar, 1990).



( M. s. = M. sojae, O. p. = O. phaseoli, 0. c. = O. centrosematis; please note, O. phaseoli does not lay eggs in the cotyledons of green gram) [Ref.: Talekar, 1990]

Agricultural Science

The foliage feeders, especially defoliators that belong to Lepidoptera and Coleoptera

include: the leaf folder, Lamprosema indica (F.); caterpillars of Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), Anticarsia irrorata (F.) the tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura (F.), the hornworms, Agris convolvuli (L.) and Acherontia styx (Westwood); the Bihar hairy caterpillar, Spilosoma obliqua (Walker), the tussock caterpillars, Euproctis fraterna (Moore), Dasychira mendosa; the weevils, Cyrtozemia dispar Pascoe, Myllocerus undecimpustulatus maculosus Desbr., Myllocerus discolor Boheman, Myllocerus viridanus Boheman, Episomus lacerata Fabr.; the hada beetle, Henosepilachna spp., chrysomelid (leaf) beetles, Monolepta signata, and the grasshopper, Attractomorpha crenulata crenulata.

Among the sap feeding insects the more common are aphids, especially black bean aphids,

Aphis craccivora Koch; jassids, Empoasca kerri Pruthi; white flies, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, thrips belonging to genus Megalurothrips and Caliothrips indicus Bagnall; the plant bugs, Riptortus spp., Nezara viridula L., Plautia fimbriata (Fabricius) and the pod bug, Clavigralla spp. They cause significant damage to green gram foliage and pods; besides causing

damage to other related legumes. It was observed that green gram cultivated in the vicinity of pigeon pea was heavily infested and rather preferred by the pigeon pea pod bug,

Clavigralla spp. (Swaminathan, et al., 2007). A linear relationship was observed between pod feeder infestation and seed loss, with the rate of seed loss being greater for Riptortus linearis and Nezara viridula than for Maruca testulalis (Hussain and Saharia, 1994).

The blister beetles (species of Mylabris) cause serious damage to the flowers, especially to the second and third flush during August – September months in most green gram cultivation

areas in India.

The key pod borers include the lepidopteran caterpillars – the spotted pod borer, Maruca testulalis (Geyer) [ Maruca vitrata] and the spiny pod borer, Etiella zinckenella Tretsche; however, the blue butterflies, Lampides boeticus Linnaeus and Catechrysops cnejus Fabricius; the gram caterpillar, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) have also been reported among the major pests.

The primary insect pests of stored green gram include species of bruchids belonging to the genus Callosobruchus. The annual yield loss is estimated to be 20 per cent in pigeonpea, 15

per cent in chickpea and 30 per cent in black gram and green gram. On an average 2.5 to 3.0

million tonnes of pulses are lost annually due to pests (Ali, 1998). Damage due to bruchids, Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) begins right from the field; adults emerging from the stored seeds lay eggs on healthy grains. The field infestation ranges from 7.8–9.9 per cent (Banto and Sanchez, 1972) and 100 per cent destruction of seeds occurred at 9.9 per cent field

infestation.

3.2 Pest management strategies

3.2.1 Organic approach

Of late, use of various cultural practices and framscaping for the management of insect pests of green gram seems to gain importance. Adjusting the sowing dates, use of resistant

varieties and growing inter or trap crops can be followed depending on the availability and effectiveness in a particular location. Since use of bio-control agents has not been successful in these crops although it is a viable alternative despite the record of several natural enemies in the field, their augmentation through farmscaping is a viable option.



Insect Pests of Green Gram Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek and Their Management

209

Farmscaping is an ecological approach to pest management; comprising the use of

hedgerows, insectary plants, cover crops, and water reservoirs to attract and support

populations of beneficial organisms such as insects, bats, and birds of prey. Such mini-

livestock requires adequate supplies of nectar, pollen, and herbivorous insects and mites as food to sustain and increase their populations. The best source of these foods is flowering plants. Flowering plants are particularly important to adults of the wasp and fly families, which require nectar and pollen sources in order to reproduce the immature larval stages

that parasitize or prey on insect pests. However, using a random selection of flowering plants to increase the biodiversity of a farm may favor pest populations over beneficial organisms.

It is important to identify those plants, planting situations, and management practices that best support populations of beneficial organisms.

There are many approaches to farmscaping: some farmers, after observing a cover crop

harboring beneficial insects, plant strips of it in or around their crop fields. The advantages of this kind of approach are that it is simple to implement, is often very effective and the farmer can modify the system after observing the results. Problems arise when the beneficial insect habitat, without the knowledge of the cultivator, also harbors pest species. In other instances the beneficials may not exist in numbers sufficient to control pest populations, especially during the time when pest populations generally increase. Predator/prey population balances are influenced by the timing of availability of nectar, pollen and alternate prey/hosts for the beneficials; therefore, essentially efforts must be made to for have year-round beneficial organism habitat and food sources. The beneficial habitat season may be

extended by adding plants that bloom sequentially throughout the growing season or the

whole year (Rex Dufor, 2000).

The mechanisms by which insectary plantings can help natural enemies of crop pests and

other beneficial arthropods are complex, and their effectiveness can vary greatly from site to site depending on the specific situation. For this reason, it is especially important that insectary plantings are planned and assessed on a case-by-case basis, and integrated into whole-farm plans for pest management and other farm operations. Insectary plantings that

are well thought out can maximize the benefits to natural enemies and minimize the benefits to pest species (Pfiffner and Wyss 2004, Quarles and Grossman 2002).

The goal of farmscaping is to prevent pest populations from becoming economically

damaging. This is accomplished primarily by providing habitat to beneficial organisms

that increase ecological pressures against pest populations. Farmscaping requires a

greater investment in knowledge, observation, and management skill than conventional

pest management tactics, while returning multiple benefits to a farm’s ecology and

economy. However, farmscaping alone may not provide adequate pest control. It is

important to monitor pest and beneficial populations so that quick action can be taken if beneficials are not able to keep pest populations in check. Measures such as maintaining

healthy soils and rotating crops are complementary to farmscaping and should be

integrated with farmscaping efforts. Bio-intensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

measures, such as the release of commercially-reared beneficials (applied biological

control) and the application of soft pesticides (soaps, oils, botanicals) can be used to

augment farmscaping efforts.





210

Agricultural Science

In a case study on the impact of farmscaping in greengram on the major insect pests and

their natural enemy complex at the College farm, Udaipur, India, a comparison of the

seasonal mean abundance of the major foliage feeding and pod damaging insect pests

showed a significant difference among the treatments. The Shanon Weiner diversity index

was the maximum under green gram + marigold weeded and unweeded farmscape

conditions being 0.7936 and 0.7790. The sole crop of green gram had the lowest diversity

index of 0.6622 for weeded and 0.6863 for unweeded conditions. Comparisons made for

the associated natural enemy complex in the different treatments showed that the

farmscape treatment green gram + niger under unweeded conditions had the highest

Shanon Weiner diversity index of 1.5932 followed by that for green gram + marigold

under unweeded conditions with an index of 1.5716. Green gram sole crop had the lowest

diversity indices being 1.2882 and 1.3854 under weeded and unweeded conditions,

respectively. Niger, by virtue of being taller than green gram, acts as a physical barrier to blister beetle infestation on green gram floral parts. Some blister beetles may happen to alight on niger flowers and cause some damage, thereby safeguarding damage to green

gram. Marigold is preferred by Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) for laying eggs; thereby, the main crop of mung bean/green gram significantly escapes the pest infestation

(Unpublished data – Swaminathan, 2011).

3.3 Cultural practices

Different cultural practices have been advocated from time to time; however, these

traditional practices and those improved happen to vary from place to place and have

responded in a varied manner. Intercropping green gram with cereals/millets (maize, sorghum and pearl millet) is often in vogue. Green gram is sown by keeping the row to row spacing at 30 cm and plant to plant distance at 10 cm. In the inter-cropped system, green gram and maize (in 1: 1 ratio) are sown in alternate rows at a distance of 30cm apart. In spring planted sugarcane, 1 or 2 rows of green gram can be planted in between the

sugarcane rows. Intercropping of green gram can also be done in Mentha. Similarly, in the newly planted poplar crop and in horticultural plants or orchards (papaya, pomegranate)

intercropping green gram is a viable option.

Weed-free crop of green gram harboured lower populations of major insect pests, while

weedy crop was conducive to their population build-up. With respect to insect infestation, keeping the field weed-free throughout the crop period was equivalent to removal of weeds up to the vegetative-3 stage of the crop. The effectiveness of weeding however varied

according to the pest species (Rekha Das Dutta, 1997).

Showler and Greenberg (2003) observed that the presence of weeds in cotton was associated with greater populations of 9 of the 11 prey arthropod groups, and 9 of the 13 natural enemy arthropod groups counted. These trends were mostly evident late in the season when weed

biomass was greatest. Weed-free cotton harboured more cotton aphids ( Aphis gossypii), early in the season and silver leaf whiteflies ( Bemisia argentifoli) later in the season than weedy cotton on some of the sampling dates. Diversity (Shannon's index) within the selected

arthropod groups counted was significantly greater in DVAC samples from the weed

foliage than from weed-free cotton plants during both years, and diversity on weedy cotton plants was greater than on weed-free cotton plants during 2000. Boll weevil oviposition

injury to squares was unaffected by weeds, but the higher weed-associated predator



Insect Pests of Green Gram Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek and Their Management

211

populations mainly occurred after most squares had become less vulnerable bolls. Weed

competition resulted in lower lint yields of 89 and 32 per cent in 2 years.

Some of the more recent literature on the impact of intercropping on insect pest situation has been reviewed herein. Populations of O. phaseoli on V. mungo and B. tabaci on cowpea increased when these crops were intercropped with maize. The incidence of yellow mosaic

was lower in intercrops of V. radiata with maize and sorghum than in monocultures.

Conversely, pod borer damage to V. radiata was lower in monocultures than in intercrops.

There was no significant difference in populations of A. soccata and C. partellus on pure and intercrops (Natarajan et al., 1991). Rekha Das Dutta (1996) observed that intercropping V igna radiata with maize resulted in reduced populations of the pests viz., Monolepta signata, Aphis craccivora, Nacolea vulgaris, Nezara viridula and Riptortus linearis on V. radiata than when intercropped with other legumes like Vigna umbellata (rice bean), Glycine max (soybean), Vigna mungo (black gram) and Arachis hypogea (groundnut). Intercropping maize and sorghum along the periphery significantly reduced the whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci) population and the damage caused by the pod borers ( Maruca testulalis [ M. vitrata] and Lampides boeticus). All intercrops resulted in increased yields over the sole crops; however, maize and sorghum intercropped along the periphery was more promising (Dar et al., 2003).

Various forms of farmscaping in the form of permanent hedgerows or temporary insectary

strips in vegetable fields to increase the activity of beneficial insects have shown that data on the effectiveness of these practices is sparse at best, as is information on the best plant species to use. The primary pest target is often aphids. The use of sweet alyssum ( Lobularia maritima) provides long periods of flowering and fits into most grower operations, yet was chosen originally for its ability to attract and provide resources to hymenopteran aphid

parasitoids. Now that the aphid species of concern has shifted from green peach aphid

( Myzus persicae) to lettuce aphid, the natural enemy of greatest importance has also shifted to hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) larvae (Chaney, 2004).

Higher numbers of arthropod pests were observed in onion plants 30 m from the marigold

strip, while higher numbers of predators and parasitoids were found at 5 m distance.

Species richness and Shannon's diversity index were higher at 5 m from marigold.

Therefore, marigold rows next to onion fields resulted in higher number of entomophagous

species, potentially enhancing the natural control of onion pests (Silveira et al., 2009).

Evaluating the suitability of some farmscaping plants as nectar sources for the parasitoid wasp, Microplitis croceipes (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Nafziger and Fadamiro (2011) observed that the greatest longevity (~16 days) was recorded for honey-fed wasps (positive control). Buckwheat significantly increased the lifespan of female and male wasps by at least two-fold as compared to wasps provided water only (longevity=3-4 days). Licorice mint

significantly increased female longevity and numerically increased male longevity. Sweet

alyssum slightly increased longevity of both sexes though was not significantly different from the water only control. Females had a significantly longer longevity than males on all the diet treatments. The greatest carbohydrate nutrient levels (sugar content and glycogen) were recorded in honey-fed wasps followed by wasps fed buckwheat, whereas very little

nutrients were detected in wasps provided sweet alyssum, licorice mint or water only.

However, female wasps were observed to attempt to feed on all three flowering plant

species.





212

Agricultural Science

Insect pest tolerant/resistant varieties have been evaluated often, but there is no single variety of green gram that might offer resistance to the major insect pests; however, some varieties are less preferred than others. Of 20 cultivars of green gram ( Vigna radiata) screened in the field in Madhya Pradesh, India, for resistance to 8 species of insect pests, PDM-84-139 and ML-382 were promising against Caliothrips indicus, an unidentified chrysomelid and a galerucid beetle, BM-112 against Raphidopalpa sp. [ Aulacophora sp.] and TAM-20, PDM-84-143 and Pusa-105 against Aphis craccivora, Amrasca kerri [ Empoasca kerri]

and Myllocerus undecimpustulatus (Devasthali and Joshi, 1994). Green gram cultivar, MV 1-6

was relatively less susceptible to both paddy grasshopper and cotton grey weevil. MI 7-21

was found to be promising against pea thrips, semilooper and cotton grey weevil but was

most susceptible to paddy grasshopper. MI-131-(Ch) was less attacked by blue beetle. The

variety MI-67-9 was less infested by bean aphid but was most susceptible to blue beetle.

Infestation of jassid was comparatively less in varieties MI-67-3 and MI-29-22 (Devasthali and Saran, 1998).

3.4 Bio-pesticide use

Pesticides of biological origin offer good response in the management of some of the

major insect pests of green gram. The fungus, Nomuraea rileyi (2 x 106 spores/ml) has been reported highly virulent under laboratory trials resulting in approximately 97.5, 93.33,

80.0 and 100.0 per cent mortality of Thysanoplusia orichalcea, Spodoptera litura, Spilosoma obliqua and Helicoverpa armigera, respectively (Ingle et al., 2004). The fungus, Paecilomyces lilacinus (0.02%) caused higher reduction in the larval population of Lampides boeticus, followed by Verticillium lecani (0.02%) and Beauveria bassiana (0.02%). While comparing the neem products, neem ( Azadirachta indica) oil (0.05%) was better than neem seed kernel extract (5%) in reducing the pod borer larval population (Arivudainambi and Chandar,

2009).

3.5 Integrated approach

Integrated management strategies involve the use of resistant varieties, use of disease free seeds, manipulation of cultural practices, management of vectors, and biological and

chemical control methods (Raguchandar et al., 1995; Vidhyasekaran and Muthamilan, 1995).

In a 2-year study (2001 and 2002), the maximum yield of maize and green gram in the

intercropped pattern (1: 1 ratio) and that as sole crop of green gram, as well as the maximum rupee equivalent yield value was recorded for the management schedule comprising release

of the green lace wing, Chrysoperla carnea at 25 DAS, spray of Azadirachta indica oil at 40 DAS

and a contact insecticide, endosulfan at 55 DAS (Kan Singh et al., 2009). Earlier, Kan Singh (2002) observed that for every unit increase in the larval density there was a significant and subsequent decrease in the number of pods per plant. The linear relationship between larval density and the reduction in number of pods per plant caused by borer damage was positive and significant for both the years. The increased reduction in number of pods as a result of increased larval density was significant. Likewise, for every unit increase in larval density there was a significant reduction in number of grains, which was reflected in the losses

caused. The estimated losses to grains were the maximum at a larval density of 4 per plant, 78.87 and 68.01 per cent for kharif 2001 and 2002, respectively. Obviously, the linear relationship between larval density and reduction in yield was significantly positive.

1. Introduction

Food production is not the only use of our agricultural landscape. The landscape also fulfils basic human needs for recreation outside the urban fringe. This chapter describes a study of how certain qualities in the rural and semi-urban landscape correspond to well-being. The study covers Skåne, the southernmost region in Sweden as well as the most productive

agricultural region. Large datasets on the environment – land use, land cover,

environmental qualities, impacts, etc. – were associated with results from a major public health survey. The results were published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community

Health (Björk et al., 2008). The chapter explains in more detail the method used to assess environmental qualities using Geographical Information System (GIS), and the relevance of these qualities for well-being and health promotion.

2. Background

A number of interview studies conducted between 1995 and 2005 in landscape

architecture/environmental psychology (Grahn, Stigsdotter and Berggren-Bärring, 2005)

have revealed eight characteristics of the outdoor environment (Serene, Wild, Lush,

Spacious, the Common, the Pleasure garden, Festive/centre and Culture) that correspond to basic human needs. The line of research in which the eight characteristics were discovered has existed for decades. Already in 1989, Kaplan and Kaplan pointed out that sounds of

nature can reduce stress and improve well-being. Several investigations have shown that

people are often afflicted by illnesses related to stress (Grahn and Stigsdotter, 2003; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005a; Ottosson and Grahn, 2005b; Ottosson and Grahn P. 2008).

Many studies have shown a relationship between urban green areas and health (Hartig et

al., 1996; Ottosson and Grahn, 1998). When walking in a natural environment, people’s

blood pressure drops already after a few minutes (Hartig, 1993). Certain biotopes and

habitats seem to have been of great importance during human evolution (Coss, 1991; Ulrich, 1993). When people are stressed or ailing and in pressed situations, the availability of such environments seems to be even more important. If people can visit environments with

certain characteristics, their blood pressure, pulse, etc., can return to normal more quickly (Ottosson and Grahn, 1998).

That the landscape promotes well-being is a common feeling among most people, but more

specific knowledge about different landscape qualities has been lacking, as have evidence from epidemiological research and hard facts that can be used in social economic

calculations.

An epidemiological study was enabled by merging data from a large regional public

health survey with regional GIS data on landscape, land-use, nature and cultural

preservation, etc.

3. Materials and methods

3.1 Public health survey

The public health survey was distributed in 2004 as a postal questionnaire in Skåne, the

southernmost region of Sweden as well as the most productive agricultural region. The study population consisted of a total of 855,599 individuals. The population was stratified by gender and geographical area. Samples were randomly selected from the population

registry. In total 50,000 questionnaires were sent out to individuals 18-80 years of age who had geocoded residential addresses. The participation rate was 59%. Survey questions posed to respondents included topics such as neighbourhood satisfaction, time spent on moderate physical activity per week, body mass index (BMI), self-rated physical and psychological

health at present, and a 36-item short-form health survey item called “vitality”.

Neighbourhood satisfaction was measured in the survey by the question ‘How much do you

like the environment you live in?’ Participants scored their level of satisfaction on a four-point ordinal scale with an additional ‘don’t know’ option. For individuals using that

answer, neighbourhood satisfaction was unknown and was therefore excluded in the

analyses that use neighbourhood satisfaction as outcome vatiable. Blank answers to this

question, or to any of the other questions that represent outcome variables (i.e. physical activity, length and weight used to calculate BMI and self-rated health), were also excluded in corresponding analyses and for the same reason (Björk et al., 2008).

The questionnaire was not pretested for clarity, but parts of the survey had been used in the year 2000 in the same region. A steering committee, with representatives from the county, municipalities and the research community, drafted the survey questions carefully before

launching the questionnaire. Validated questions were used when available.

3.2 Environmental qualities for well-being

A number of studies in the fields of environmental psychology and landscape architecture at SLU, the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, have resulted in new assessment

criteria for recreational values. This research revealed eight characteristics of outdoor recreation values that correspond to basic human needs: Wild, Lush, Spacious, the

Common, the Pleasure garden, Festive/centre and Culture/History (see Table 1). Thus far,

these values have mainly been studied on a local scale, in parks, gardens, and small forests, but also at the neighbourhood and urban fringe level. In the present study, the

characteristics are applied at the regional level.

Berggren-Bärring, 2005).

3.3 Assessing characteristics for well-being on a regional scale using GIS

GIS data from the county administration were used to elaborate characteristics. Corine land cover data play a vital role in this classification, as do other data of relevance, such as topography, environmental protection, noise disturbance, etc. CORINE (Coordination of

Information on the Environment) is a programme initiated by the European Commission in

1985 to compile information on the environment with regard to certain topics and to ensure that information is consistent and that data are compatible across member states. One main part of the programme is the Corine land cover project covering 12 countries with a working scale of 1:100,000, and the smallest mapping unit 25 hectares. Sweden, however, has used a more detailed working scale with 5 hectares as the smallest mapping unit

(Lantmäteriverket, 2003). Since the inventory of Corine land cover data is a European

project, data corresponding to the present data should be available for most European

countries.

Other data sources for this project are administrated at the County Administration level

and deal with, e.g., natural and cultural protection areas, key biotopes, a pasture land

inventory, Nature 2000, a beach zone protection plan and a regional inventory of “silent

areas” (a large-scale noise impact calculation). In addition to this topographic evaluation, data from the land survey administration were used.

Of significance in assessing characteristics for recreation on a large regional scale is that only existing data sources can be used for evaluation. In the present study, no resources, neither time nor money, have been available for a detailed systematic process of ground truth

validation of different classification methods. However, the studied region is well known to 228

Agricultural Science

members of the research group, which facilitated preliminary and overall checks of the

produced classification maps.

After testing different alternatives for identification of the characteristics, including revisions, we ended up with the classification in Table 2. The final maps are presented at the end of the chapter

The Agricultural Landscape for Recreation

229

In the present regional study, we have limited our investigation to the five characteristics Serene, Wild, Lush, Spacious and Culture, as the three characteristics the Common, the

Pleasure garden and Festive/centre require local data from the municipalities not available at the time of the study.

Also we have excluded the four largest cities in Skåne (Malmö, Lund, Helsingborg and

Kristianstad) but kept smaller towns and villages. In cities, large parks and other inner city green areas are a main recreational resource for residents. GIS data to elaborate

characteristics of these areas are not available on a regional level. Therefore, the present study is limited to the rural and semi-urban areas of Skåne.

3.4 Statistical analysis

This study included 24,819 respondents located using their residential coordinates. Using GIS, the presence/absence of each of the five characteristics within 300 m from each

respondent was defined based on the criteria in Table 2. The working process for the

assessment of the characteristics is described in Results below. Table 3 shows the percentage of the population living close (300 m or 100 m) to the different characteristics. Spearmanś rank correlation coefficient, appropriate for investigating associations between ordinal

scales, was used to test associations statistically between the number of characteristics (0-5) present within 300 m or 100 m of the respondent’s residence and ordered answers to the

survey questions. P-values below 0.05, and equivalently 95% confidence intervals for odds ratios excluding unity in ordinal regression analyses with adjustments for a broad list of individual determinants of health, were regarded as statistically significant (Björk et al.

2008).

meters distance from their residence.

Each respondent’s coordinates are defined as the centre point of the complex in which

he/she lives. That centre point can be quite far from the position of the person’s home,

making the 100 m distance incorrect. 300 meters is a fairly normal distance to walk to get to a nature area or a park.

Agricultural Science

One outcome of the study is that the objectively GIS-assessed availability of the five

characteristics near one’s residence (< 300 m) is positively associated with neighbourhood satisfaction (Figure 1), moderate physical activity (Figure 2) and, among tenants, low BMI.

Thus, figure 2 suggests that individuals spend more time on average on moderately

demanding physical activities the more characteristics they have within 300 m from home.

This association remained after adjustment for individual (socioeconomic) factors.

The impact of the number of characteristics on BMI was less clear. After adjustment for

individual factors associated with BMI, the beneficial effect of the characteristics was present among tenants but not among house-owners. The proportion of obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2)

individuals among tenants was 17% in residences with zero characteristics within 300

metres compared with 13% in residences with at least one characteristics present (Björk et al 2008). No clear association between the number of characteristics and self-rated general

health was detected after adjustment for individual factors.

The result for neighbourhood satisfaction among people living in flats is remarkable. If all five characteristics exist within 300 m, 70% of the tenants are satisfied with their

neighbourhood, whereas a maximum of 50% are satisfied if only one or no characteristics

are present. The corresponding figures for house owners are 83 % and 74 %. Consequently,

house owners seem to be rather satisfied with having their own garden, while tenants’ wellbeing is highly dependent on having good natural environments or parks within 300 m from

home. This provides important input to the current debate on global warming and

densification in urban planning. We are supposed to live more densely in cities to minimize commuting to our workplaces, but on the other hand, if we do not have sufficient nature

and park qualities close to our homes in the cities, we will need to commute into the rural landscape for recreation, and that also has an impact on the climate effect.

3.5 Results – Working process for the assessment of characteristics

The choice of criteria for elaborating each characteristic using GIS was in some cases a long process in which different combinations of classes of parameters for accessing each

characteristic were elaborated successively. These trials generally started with a discussion among the research group members to develop a first set of criteria for identification. The first attempt at classification aimed at achieving an appropriate number of areas for the concerned characteristic, not too many and not too few.

As seen in Table 3, the scope of characteristics close to respondents on average differs

substantially. Culture and Lush are most common. Wild and serene are most rare.





232

Agricultural Science

The resulting maps were examined by the project staff and compared to their own

experiences of certain areas in the studied region. After critical studies of the resulting maps, other classification criteria were tested in a second attempt, and so on in further attempts until the final classification versions were established – those found in Table 2. At the end of the paper, you can see the five maps of the final classification.

3.5.1 Serene

The effort to develop the classification model can be illustrated to some extent by looking at the work with the characteristic Serene. For Serene, we first used a minimum size criterion: Areas should have a minimum size of 20 hectares to be classified as Serene. The reason for this was that an area must be relatively large to be perceived as Serene. From the beginning, we also claimed that the average noise level should not exceed 40 dB(A)24 h, and that a 250 m buffer along roads and dwellings was required. Moreover, we required a buffer of 800 m

around large wind power generators and shooting ranges.

Later on, the area size criterion for Serene proved to be useless, as a single large forest often consists of several serene land use areas grouped together, each of which is smaller than 20

hectares. Therefore we rejected that size criterion. We also rejected the minimum distance criterion to roads and wind power generators. The noise criterion, however, was sharpened to 30 dB(A)24h. This is perhaps the reason for the relatively rare presence (Table 3) of Serene near the residents.

3.5.2 Wild

Forests, thickets, bare rock, mires and wetlands, lakes and rivers – all larger than 15 ha, if not closer than 1 kilometre from villages and towns. If closer, there is no minimum size for the area, because children seem to sense the Wild characteristic even in very small areas.

Also areas steeper than 10° are classified as Wild.

Excluded are areas with a noise level over 40 dB(A), and areas with wind generators within 800 m.

In our first attempts, we set the minimum size of areas to 30 ha and to 5 ha within 1 km from villages and towns. But that reduced the amount of Wild too drastically.

3.5.3 Lush

Mixed forest, marshes and mires, beaches, dunes, sand plains and bear rock. Plus all

registered “key biotopes”, certain inventories of pasture land, biodiversity areas, bird

biotopes of regional interest, also Nature 2000 objects and national parks.

Many of the mixed forests are very small areas, down to 25 x 25 m integrated in the open

agricultural landscape, and these are of great importance to biodiversity from an

ecological as well as recreational point of view. At our first attempt we included a buffer zone of 100 m. The reason was that fringe zones between different biotopes are very

species rich, and we wanted to capture that by including a buffer zone in the biotope area concerned. However, this resulted in areas that were far too large to make the

classification useful. One hundred meters is an overestimate of specious rich fringe zones, they are narrower than this.



The Agricultural Landscape for Recreation

233

The best areas cannot be drowned in an overly generous classification, which is a general problem in most landscape analysis. Therefore, this buffer zone was rejected from our

classification. Despite this rejection, Lush was classified close to a large percentage of the population.

3.5.4 Space

Beaches, dunes, and sand plains, bare rock, sparsely vegetated areas, burnt areas, natural grassland, moors and heath land, all forests larger than 25 ha. Plus slopes more than 10

degrees (creating viewpoints), farmland pointed out in a preservation plan and coastal zone preservation in a national plan.

Excluded are areas with a noise level over 40 dB(A).

In our first attempt, we used minimum size criteria: Forest 100 ha; natural grassland 20

ha; heath 50 ha. This resulted in very few areas. One observation was that many open

space areas are small, but together form large open spaces. Therefore the size criteria for grassland and heath were rejected in our classification. Moreover, forests of different

categories are in reality rather small, but together form large forest areas, giving the

impression of “entering another world”. To address this, we reduced the size criterion for forest to 25 ha.

In our first attempt, we also used noise level criteria for roads 250 m from the residence, but rejected these as being too high in many cases. At first we also used 800 m minimum

distance to wind power aggregates as a criterion for obstructing a feeling restfulness, but later rejected this as well.

3.5.5 Culture

Non-urban parks, farmland pointed out in a preservation plan, areas of national interest in cultural preservation, nature reservation areas.

In our first attempt, we also included national interests in recreation. Such areas often overlap national interests in cultural preservation, and are in these cases included anyway.

However, they also include large areas for recreation without meeting criteria for the

Culture characteristic, but instead for some of the other characteristics, so that dataset was rejected from Culture. Culture was classified as being close to a relatively large percentage of the population (see Table 3).

4. Discussion

When conducting a regional analysis of environmental perception, there are a great many

pitfalls to consider. Regional studies require existing datasets mainly produced to show

objective data, but perception is a subjective interpretation of the real environment. Peopleś perceptions also differ from individual to individual due to their previous experiences. This, however, is a general issue independent of the scale of the study. For these kinds of studies, the elaboration of classification criteria always has to be done by representatives of the local community.





234

Agricultural Science

The present epidemiological study aimed at finding general associations between well-being and proximity to nature for the population in Skåne. Epidemiological studies provide

overall patterns of associations and variations. These kinds of studies do not necessarily give a “correct” picture of individual cases.

One pitfall of using objective data such as forest types, topography, etc., is the issue of interpreting and combining the data so they correspond to common perceptions of nature

characteristics. That is what the present paper tries to describe. It is the first study of its kind, and there is a great deal more research to be done to improve the methods. One issue, for example, is that Corine land cover data are derived from an analysis of satellite data, and this is associated with a relatively large percentage of misinterpretation, for some land use types around 30% (Rost & Ahlcrona, 2005).

Because the book focuses on agriculture, we would like to comment additionally on the

agricultural landscape. Skåne is in the southwestern half of the region dominated by

agriculture. The soil is fertile. Avenues and other landscape elements are impressive. A

rather flat zone 30 kilometres wide and following the southern and western coast is the

most productive part (the Baltic moraine clay), and is at the same time the most urbanized area, with many roads and railroads creating noise. To some extent this zone is spacious

and includes long views, but it is not particularly accessible for walking, and walking

promotes a feeling of restfulness. More accessible is the diagonal zone of Skåne from

southeast to northwest. This zone has more hills and small scale farmland and is more

accessible and silent, offering a restful feeling of “entering another world”, a coherent whole. Both zones are rich in impressive visible cultural history, as can be seen in the last map.

There is a need for validation of this kind of analysis. High correlations between the

prevalence of GIS-evaluated characteristics and people’s responses concerning health and

well-being indicate that development of parameters for GIS evaluation is on the right path.

Overall, we found a high correlation between peopleś perception of a cosy atmosphere and

the prevalence of the characteristics. The Skåne study shows that the rural landscape, both arable land and forests, plays an important role in health promotion.

The Swedish National Institute of Public Health now recommends these characteristics as

a checklist for green planning (FHI, 2009). The eight characteristics have been

implemented in a number of planning projects for housing and infrastructure in Sweden

(Skärbäck, 2007).

5. Conclusion

In the study by Björk et al. (2008) green characteristics of the nearby natural environment was shown to be positively associated with neighbourhood satisfaction and physical

activity. The association with neighbourhood satisfaction was especially marked among

tenants, and a beneficial effect on BMI was also noted in this group. No evident effect of the green characteristics on self-rated health was detectable. The cross-sectional design limits definite conclusions regarding cause-effects. A further limitation is that the study was

restricted to rural and semi-urban areas and the generalizability of the results to inner-city areas is therefore uncertain.

1. Introduction

Shortages of feed during the dry season and sometimes during the wet season put a

constraint to livestock production in almost every production system in Nigeria. Where

feeds are found in abundance, they may be low in nutritive value which may manifest

themselves in form of nutritional deficiencies when fed to animals. Increasing livestock

production depends to a large extent on the availability of suitable feed resources. Forages in various conservation methods play a significant role in the nutrition of ruminant animals in general.

In large measure, the current under production of animal protein in the developing world is caused by lack of forages. Trees and shrubs play a dual role in the forage supply serving both as shade for grasses and as forage themselves (Nas, 1979). In dry savannas in

particular, shrubs and trees are very precious, without them, stock raising would probably be impossible for pasture grasses die when upper soil layers lose their moisture, but the tree roots exploit deep underground moisture and they continue to flourish.

During the dry season, trees and shrubs provide green fodder leaves, flowers, fruits often rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. In the absence of forages trees and shrubs, animal have only straw from nature grasses.

The trees and shrubs can be interplanted with grasses thus increasing the carrying capacity of pastoral areas and often supplying the grazing during droughts or periods of year when other food is normally scarce (Nas, 1979). Trees products have many and often competing

uses. Foliage and young leaves is useful supplier of plants nutrients (Kang, et.al 1999). Trees such as Gliricidia sepium provide useful forage in the form of leaves and bark and is commonly used to supplement poor quantity and low protein roughage.

During the dry season, it may become a major source of feed for goats, sheep and cattle in the sub-humid zone (Kang, et.al 1999). The importance of browse plants as source of protein and energy to ruminants particularly during the dry season of the year has been extensively reviewed. (Wilson,1969). However, browse plant cannot constitute a complete feed when

fed alone. They should be given adequate attention in the feeding management of sheep

(Carew, 1983).



246

Agricultural Science

Small ruminant production is an important segment of agricultural sector that forms a

significant component of most farming systems in the country whether pastoral or

agricultural.

Nigeria has a population of 56.599 million small ruminants of which goats and sheep

accounted for 34.4-85 million and 22.104 million respectively (FNPCPS,1980) of an estimated Africa small ruminant population of 349.4 million.

Information on the utilization of Adansonia digitata bark as feed for ruminants in general and WAD rams in particular has not been documented.

2. Literature review

2.1 Adansonia digitata

Some trees are valued as excellent sources of forage feed for ruminant animals while they are known as noxious weeds in some areas. A tree, such as Leucaena leucocephala has been

shown to have great potential as a source of high quality feed for ruminants and also

capable of improving intake of poor quality rouphage and live weight gain in large and

small ruminants.

Adansonia digitata linn (English: baobab; Yoruba: Ose; Hausa: Kuka; Nupe: Machi;

Kanuri: kuka; Bini: Usi.) is a tropical tree specie popularly called the Baobab tree. It has distinctive large flower and fruits hanging from long stalks. It is wide spread in the drier regions of Africa. It is much more widespread in the savanna of Nigeria where it is

usually planted or presented. The tree is about 25m high with a very stout bole reaching

12m in girth. The bark is grey or purplish and thick. The bark produces a strong fibre resulting in its being stripped off. Hence, the trunk is often much more deformed. (Keay, et.al. 1965).

The pulp of baobab tree was found to be acidic and rich in ascorbic acid, iron, calcium and pectin. The pectin was mainly water soluble and had a low degree of esterification and a

low intrinsic viscosity. (Nour, et.al. 1980)

According to purseglove (1968) the fruit pulp which contains tartaric acid is made into a drink and is also used as a fruit seasonal. In the Sudan, the pulp is commonly chewed,

sucked or made into a drink. The kernels are edible and the seed contain 19% oil.

2.2 Importance and characteristics of sheep

Sheep together with goats, Ilamas and alpacas are small ruminants because they are ruminants; they eat low quality food, particularly fibrous vegetation which cannot be

eaten by humans and non-ruminant animals such as pigs and poultry. People keep sheep

because they produce meat, milk, wool or hair, skins and manure. Sheep are the only

species of animal that produce wool, although goats, rabbits and alpacas sometimes

produce similar high quality fibre. Therefore sheep are a way of converting poor quality

food into desirable products. Breeds which have to survive along dry season often have a

fat tail or rump which is a store of energy equivalent to the hump of camels or cattle

(Gatenby, R.M, 1991).

2.3 Feeding

A variety of feeds are used throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. Sheep are known as

herbivores; feeding readily on a wide range of plant except poisonous ones. Under

certain condition they feed on every parts of the plants within their reach such as leaves, stem, flowers, seeds, barks and fruits. Some of the pasture that are common in Nigeria

include Cynodon emiensis, Andropogon gayanus, Panicum maximum. Some other crop

residues and agro-industrial by-products are also used in feeding sheep e.g. cassava

peels, yam peels, maize offals, wheat offal, PKC, BDG, Bone meal and Cereal straws.

There is no sufficient information on the nutrient requirement of livestock. (Akinyosinu, 1985).

3. Effect of heat stress on animal productivity

High ambient temperatures depress body activities which viewed homeostatically are

biological mechanism for preventing overheating. The climatic condition also affect the

amount of food and water intake, the availability of the potential energy in the ingested forage, the animals heat production system, the net energy available for productivity and the body composition of growing animal (Hafez, 1968).

Pulse rate which is expressed in beats per minutes is like the respiratory rate inversely proportional to the weight (W) of the animal, it can also alter rapidly due to external factor such as temperature or intense activity by the animal itself. Bianca and Findlay (1962)

showed that exposure of sheep to severe heat for a short period increased pulse rate but

exposure to relatively long period decreased pulse rate. Pulse rate is usually higher in small animals than in large animals due to the relatively high metabolic rate of small species

(Bianca, 1968).

Respiratory rate can change rapidly and at the extreme, in a matter of minutes. It is

indirectly influenced by the animal’s activity and by environmental being inversely

proportional to the volume of the animal.

Rectal temperature is taken to be equivalent to the body temperature. Body temperature

is the best indicator of the good health of the animal and its variation above and below

normal is a measure of the animal’s aptitude to resist hardship factors of the

environment.

4. Objectives of the study

The broad objective is to determine the performance of WAD Ram fed Adansonia digitata bark based concentrate supplement.

The specific objectives are

1. To determine the composition of experimental diets

2. To determine the proximate analysis of Adansonia digitata bark and Wheat Offal

3. To determine the performance of West African Dwarf (WAD) rams fed Baobab bark-

based concentrate diet.

4. To estimate the effect on pulse rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature.

Agricultural Science

4.1 Materials and methods

The study was carried out in the teaching and Research Farm, University of agriculture,

Abeokuta, Nigeria. (Latitude 7o 5.5’N – 7o 8’N, Longitude 3o 11.2’ – 3o3.5’E and Latitude 76.

5. Animals and their management

Twenty healthy growing WAD rams of about 8-10 months of age, with average body weight

of 10.2kg were used for the experiment. The WAD rams were separated from the rest of the

flock in the small ruminant unit of the teaching and research farm for three weeks into

previously disinfected, well ventilated and illuminated pens with wood shavings as litter materials. Panicum maximum was supplied in liberal amount. Five litres of water per day were supplied in each pen containing 5 rams. The animals were dewormed with Banminth

II wormer (12.5g/kg body weight) and bathed with asuntol powder solution R (3g/litre of

water) to eliminate possible ectoparasites. Clout R was applied at 4 weeks intervals along the spine of the animals to check against possible mange infection. At the end of 3 weeks pre-experimental management period, the animals were grouped into 4 with five animals per

treatment, balanced for body weight.

6. Dietary treatment

The basal diet for the experiment was guinea grass (Panicum maximum). Four concentrate

diets with different levels of adansonia digitata (0, 5, 10, and 15%) were prepared. (Table 1).

The four groups of WAD rams were randomly assigned to the treatments using completely

randomized designed (CRD) with the treatment as the only source of variability apart from the experimental error. The animals were supplied concentrate twice daily between the

hours of 8 and 9a.m and 3 and 4p.m at the rate of 0.4kg/animal/day out which 0.2kg was

supplied in the morning and 0.2 in the afternoon so as to control feed wastages. Each group was also supplied 5 litres of water daily. The dietary treatment lasted for 10 weeks

excluding one week dietary adjustment period. The one week dietary adjustment period

was to flush out the residues of the previous feed from the gut of the rams thereby

eliminating carry-over effects of previous feed.

7. Method of data collection

After an adjustment period of one week, daily data collection followed. The animals were

fasted by withdrawing feed only for 14- 16 hours and allowing them access to water. The

body weight were taken after the fasting prior to the commencement of the experiment and

taken again every fortnight. Feed residues and left-over water were recorded every morning before fresh feeds and water were supplied.

Pulse rate was taken for each animal by placing the finger on the femoral arteries on the medial aspect of the hind limb for one minute using a stop-watch, respiratory rate was taken for each animal by counting the number of flank movements per minute using stop-watch

while the rectal temperature was taken using a clinical thermometer which was allowed to

stay in the rectum of each animal for one minute before the reading was taken. (Fasoro,

1999). The physiological parameters (pulse rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature) were taken for three consecutive days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) before the

commencement of the experiment and every fortnight on each animal between 7 and 9a.m

on each day. The average air temperature and relative humidity recorded during this study were 350C and 54.5% respectively using wet and dry thermometer.

8. Results

Table 1 above showed the composition of experimental concentrate diet to be used for the

experiment. Wheat offal was supplied at different percentages in the diets starting from 50, 45, 40 and 35 contained in the treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, this was supplied in different levels because wheat offal had high percentage of dry matter content of 89% while adansonia digitata bark was low in dry matter content (Table 2). PKC, Bone meal, Salt and BDG was supplied in the diet with the same percentage of 20, 1, 1 and 28 in the treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Baobab bark was supplied in the diet with different levels 0, 5, 10

and 15 in the treatments 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

Table 4 showed that the differences among treatments for pulse rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature at the end of the experiment were not significantly different from initial conditions. This shows uniformity in the environmental parameters, physiological state of the animals and lack of effect of dietary treatments on the animals.

9. Discussion

The high level of moisture content (89.3%) in the baobab bark could be an advantage as sole feed for ruminants in the period of scarcity of water. The consumption of high water content forages reduces water intake by ruminant, but may however make for difficulties in

obtaining a sufficiently high DMI (payne, 1990). The 10.70% crude protein in the Baobab

bark appears to be adequate in the compounded ration of ruminant. A diet of 10% crude protein has been reported adequate in meeting the maintenance requirements of sheep and

goats (NRC, 1980). Adansonia digitata bark would appear from the proximate component,

to be adequate as sole feed supplement for sheep.

It appears that the grass was more preferred than the concentrate. The preference of the

experimental rams for grass over concentrate supplement could be attributed to the more

succulent nature of the grass than the dry and coarse concentrate supplement. The higher

intake of grass in all the diets is an index of the better acceptability of the grass forage to the rams than concentrate diet containing baobab bark (Aina, 1998). However, the animals

responded better in terms of ADG and DMI as the inclusion level increased in the

concentrate diet than the control. The results also suggested clearly that the rams treated with D4 showed the highest total DMI, FCR and ADG compared with other treatment

groups (Table 3). The increasing DMI of concentrate diet with increasing level of baobab

bark inclusion up to the maximum (D4) is an indication that higher levels may still be

accommodated by the animals. The increasing growth rate with increasing baobab inclusion

in the diet suggested beneficial effects of the bark and an encouragement for better

performance in the WAD rams.

The results of the environmental and physiological parameters (Table 4) show the

uniformity in the environmental parameters and physiological status of the animals as well as lack of effect of dietary treatments on those physiological parameters of the animals. The pulse rate (beats/min) range of 76-78 agree with the records of Olusanya and Heath (1988) who stated that the heart rate of sheep falls into the range 60-120 beats/min. It can thus be inferred that the baobab bark inclusion in the diet of sheep up to 15% of the compounded

diet is safe for consumption.

10. Conclusion

From this present study, it can be concluded that to get a better performance than control, the concentrate supplement must contain about 15% inclusion of Adansonia digitata in the

diets of rams. However, higher level of inclusion of baobab bark beyond 15% in the

concentrate supplement for sheep is recommended since the highest level in the trial (15%) induced the highest performance.
